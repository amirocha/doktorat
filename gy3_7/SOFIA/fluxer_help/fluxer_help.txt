FLUXER is a processing and visualization tool for astronomical data cubes. 
This tool was created to deal with data delivered by imaging field
spectrographs like OSIRIS@Keck or SINFONI@VLT.

An astronomical data cube is a three-dimensional matrix with two spatial axes
(right ascencion and declination) and a wavelength axis. Data in such cubes is
usually equidistantly gridded and only such kind of data is fully supported.
A slice of a data cube is considered here as a data matrix (image) extracted
at constant wavelength.  

Capabilities:
	- Automatic and manual identification of crazy pixels in data cubes
	- Interpolation of crazy pixels in 1, 2, or pseudo-3 dimensions 
	- Operations on data cubes, like e.g. smoothing each slice of a data
	  cube with a gaussian PSF of median filtering each slice
        - Interactive and automatic fitting to emission/absorption lines with
	  various profiles, thus extracting of e.g. flux maps, velocity
	  fields, ...
        - Extraction of spectra from data cubes
	- Creation of animated channel maps in gif format (for UNIX only)
        - Data cube viewing in 2D and 3D
	- Viewing the fitsheader if provided
	- Advanced postscript plotting
	- Creation of Viewing masks for better plot results and analysis
	- ...

FULL functionality ONLY with a three(!)-button mouse

SOME NOTES ON FLUX and SIGMA:
-----------------------------

     - What is called flux e.g. derived from a gaussian fit, is the area of
       the gaussian divided by the spectral bin width! 

     - Gaussian width is the gaussian dispersion (sigma). 
       Lorentzian width is the HWHM.
       In all other line fitting modes, the width is always the full width.
       When a plot is to be displayed in km/s, always the full width is
       meant (in Gaussian mode 2.35*sigma or 2.*HWHM in lorentzian mode).

Usage: 
------
       IDL> fluxer, input

       input: Either a fits filename in single quotes, e.g. 'my_data.fits'
              or a data cube.

       Fitsfile:
       When reading fits files, Fluxer determines the number of extensions of
       this file and asks which to load. When reading an extension, Fluxer
       tries to read the header of the primary as well as of the extension. 
       Both headers are then merged (see also below, under 'Side effects (not
       errors)'). If a data cube is read, the last 
       (third) axis is always considered as the slicing index. This means that
       the first two axes describe an image, the third the stacking of the
       images. When dealing with astronomical data cubes read from a fits
       file, these must follow fits conventions. E.g. the order of the axes
       must be right ascension, declination, wavelength. 
       Wavelengths and Astrometry with fluxer is only available when the
       appropriate information is defined in the fitsfile's header or when the
       header keyword is used (see also optional input parameters). 

       After the primary data is loaded, Fluxer starts another dialog which
       allows to supply further data to Fluxer. Check the 'Help' button in
       that dialog for help.

       Providing a data cube:
       A data cube can be provided to fluxer directly from command line. 
       In this case no wavelength information nor astrometry is generated
       unless you specifiy an appropriate header using the header keyword. 
       If only the data cube is provided to fluxer, the user will be asked for
       the slicing axis. Select an axis or click 'Auto' which selects
       automatically the axis with the most elements.
       If additionally a header is supplied using the header keyword, the data
       cube must comply to fits conventions and the third axis is considered
       as the slicing direction.

       The following table summarizes the behaviour together with header
       keyword (see also optional input parameters):
       ---------------------------------------------------------------------

                        w. header keyword set    wo. header keyword set

       Fitsfile         3. axis is slicing       3. axis is slicing 
       		        direction  		 direction

       Data cube	3. axis is slicing       slicing direction
                        direction  		 can be chosen

       ---------------------------------------------------------------------

       In general:
       Fluxer always generates a mask with pixels that shall contain light or
       are just fillers. Data values in the cube that are INF or NAN are
       assumed to be fillers. Spectra which contain only a value of 0. are
       assumed to be fillers as well. Fillers are marked as outside. They can
       not be used for anything and can not be interpolated.


Optional input parameters:
--------------------------

	plotchannels=plotchannels : Number of spectral channels to be plotted
		                    in the plot window. Must be greater than 10.
        LineFile=LineFile         : Line identification table (see the preferences 
                                    section below for the format of this file).
        header=header             : Allows the user to parse a header. If a fitsfile has
		                    been read the header from the fitsfile is ignored.


General functionality:
----------------------

   Fluxer provides three modes of data cube manipulation:

   Spatial healing    : Identify and interpolate bad pixels in 
   	   	      	individual slices (spectral channels)
   Wavelength healing : Identify and interpolate bad pixels in 
   	   	      	individual spectra
   Line fitting       : Fit emission/absorption lines in individual or 
                        all spectra

   Only one of these modes can be used at a time.

   Additional functionality that can be used in all modes:
   - Automatic bad pixel search with various methods.
   - Simple cube manipulation like median filtering each slice or convolving
     each slice with a gaussian PSF

On startup:
-----------

       The main GUI pops up. 

       What you see:

       On the left side of the GUI the parameter section is located where most 
       of the parameters including methods can be specified.
       On the right side of the GUI are two panel windows. The left (panel
       window 1) shows the currently selected slice. Marked or outside pixel
       have the lowest possible colorindex according to the selected colortable. 
       The right panel window (panel window 2) shows the same slice with
       marked pixels being interpolated if a healing mode is active or the
       result in case of line fitting.
       Below the panel window text windows (Info area) display information
       about the world coordinate system, if available, about data at the
       current mouse position and fit results if in line fitting mode (see
       'Info areas' below). 
       To the left, in the middle, there is a text window displaying messages
       from fluxer to you (Message area). At the bottom the plot window is
       located. Here the current spectrum is displayed. 
       To the right of the plot window (Plotting parameter area), plotting
       parameters can be set.

       The GUI should not be resized. However, you can resize the panel
       windows and the plot window see Pref ->  Change window sizes in the
       main menu bar.

       In the menu bar you find additional functionality.

       -------------------------------------------------------------------



Using help:
-----------

   For all modes exist help pages. For further information about any mode
   click the appropriate Help button in the GUI.

   In all help pages : marked pixels = queued pixels = pixels that are marked
			for interpolation = pixel that shall not be used in,
			e.g., a fit 
                       good pixel    = pixels that are not marked

                       inside pixel  = pixel that shall contain light
                       outside pixel = pixel that do not contain light


Side effects (not errors) :
---------------------------
     - Defines two system variables :!TEXTOUT and !TEXTUNIT

     - Changes several parameters in !P

     - One of the first commands fluxer executes is 'device, decomposed=0'

     - The colortable will be modified.

     - Fluxer takes its time when applying complicated interpolation
       methods on many pixels. This is because IDL can be slooooooooooow.

     - GEMINI fits files come with a primary and extension. The primary does
       not contain data, only a header. The extension contains a header and
       data. Since Fluxer can only handle one header, the headers are merged.
       A standard header according to the data being loaded is
       created into which, first, the header of the primary and, second, the
       header of the extension are inserted. In case of double occurances of
       header keywords, the already existing keyword will be preserved.

Astro header :
--------------
WCS functionality only works if the astro header is correctly specified. 
E.g. Compass and scalebar are determined by astro functions that evaluate the
astro header. The WCS string generation is taken from atv.pro.
Definition of the WCS is not really standardized and may differ amongst
observatories. 

E.g. the WCS works if the following keywords are present:

- CRVALi, CRPIXi, CDELTi, CTYPEi with i = 1..3
- Either RADECSYS, EQUINOX or EPOCH for defining the equinox
- CD1_1, CD1_2, CD2_1, CD2_2 for defining the rotation of the WCS
- Astrometric information is only read according to extast. Any
  non-standard telescope offset or similar is ignored.


Notes about GEMINI fits data:

   GEMINI fits files come with a primary and extension. The primary does
   not contain data, only a header. The extension contains a header and
   data. Since Fluxer can only handle one header, the headers are merged.
   A standard header according to the data being loaded is
   created into which, first, the header of the primary and, second, the
   header of the extension are inserted. In case of double occurances of
   header keywords, the already existing keyword will be preserved.


Additional header keywords recognized by fluxer:
------------------------------------------------

OBJECT    : Name of the object
OBS-DATE  : Date of observation
ORIGIN    : Observatory
REDSHIFT  : Redshift of the source. If specified and wavelengths are present 
            fluxer automatically applies this redshift to the wavelengths.


Wavelength definition:
----------------------

From version 2.36 on wavelengths are defined as 
(dindgen(# of channels)-(CRPIX-1))*CDELT+CRVAL

Prior to version 2.36 wavelengths were defined as 
(dindgen(# of channels)-CRPIX)*CDELT+CRVAL

Fits convention starts with 1, idl convention with 0.


ATV:
----

Fluxer comes with version 2.3 of atv.pro by A. Barth named fluxer_atv.pro. 
fluxer_atv.pro is identical to atv.pro but has been modified in many ways.
Additional capabilities like marking bad pixel, interpolating bad pixel and
finding bad pixel has been introduced. For further explanations see the help
page that can be started from fluxer_atv.
