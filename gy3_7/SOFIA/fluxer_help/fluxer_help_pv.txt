Fluxer allows extraction of spectra from the data cube from an arbitrary 
aligned slit. To do so, select 'Slit' in the 'Panel Mouse Mode' section.
Fluxer also allows to plot a position velocity (PV) diagram.

Available mouse button actions are summarized in 'Help->Mouse Modes' from the
main menubar.

The length (in spectral direction) of the extracted spectra can be chosen to
be either the length that is displayed in the Plot window (and controlled by
the parameter 'half # of slices' left in the Plot seciotn of the GUI) or the
full length of the spectra. Be aware that extracting full length spectra may
take some time.


Slit extraction :
-----------------

Available mouse button actions are:

   - Left click-hold-move defines the slit. The slit is plotted in both panel
        windows. 

   - Right click extracts the spectra from the slit and saves the
   	   result to a fitsfile.

   - Middle click invokes a GUI that allows to set the slit parameters like,
   	    stepwidth, the slit width and the oversampling factor for
   	    extracting the spectra.

Slit parameters:

   Half width of slit        : This is the half width of the slit. The true
                               width is twice this number plus one.
   Half step size along slit : This is the half step size along the slit. The
                               true step size is twice this number plur one.

                               -> The subapertures have a size of 
                               (2*halfwidth+1)^2

   Sampling                  : Spectra are extracted by oversampling the data
                               cube in all angular axes. Sampling is the
                               factor by which each slice of the 
                               data cube is oversampled to get the value of
                               the extracted spectrum at a specific location
                               along the slit. 

   Cancel                    : Closes this GUI and leaves the settings
                               unchanged. 

   Done                      : Above settings take effect after this button 
                               has been pressed. The GUI is closed.

The reference point of the slit (slit position 0) corresponds to the location
(in data units) where the left mouse button has been pressed. It is displayed
in red. 

Data stored to fitsfile :
-------------------------

The stored data format is as follows:

    The following keywords are added to the header:

   Keyword      Value
   'FLUXER'    : 'SLIT' This keyword is checked when viewing a PV diagramm
                 using fluxer_plot_pv of from within Fluxer.
   'ANCHORX'   : the x starting point of the slit in data coordinates
   'ANCHORY'   : the y starting point of the slit in data coordinates
   'ANGLE'     : the angle of the slit in radian. The angle is 0. at 9 o'clock
                 and counts positive ccw.
   'SAMPLING'  : the oversampling factor selected in the 'Extract slit
                 spectra' dialog 
   'SLITSTEP'  : the step size selected in the 'Extract slit
                 spectra' dialog 
   'SLITWIDT'  : the slit width in pixel
   'CDELT2'    : the spacing of the wavelength axis
   'CRPIX2'    : the reference pixel of the wavelength axis
   'CRVAL2'    : the wavelength value at the reference pixel
   'WUNIT'     : 'WAVE' if wavelengths are present, 'INDEX' if no wavelengths
                 are present
   'WUNIT2'    : 'Angstroem','Nm','Micron' unit of the wavelengths if
                 wavelengths are present, 'Pixel' otherwise.

   The fitsfile contains several extensions:
   0. ext.  : the extracted spectra as an image with dimension [# of spectral
              channels, # of spectra] 
   1. ext.  : an image with same format as extension 0. 1: where a valid value
              has been found (inside), 0 else (outside)
   2. ext.  : an image with same format as extension 0 giving the number of
              valid oversampled data elements per element. Since the extracted
              spectra are averaged over the subaperture, the total flux can be
              reconstructed by multiplying this image to extension 0 and
              dividing by sampling^2  
   3. ext.  : a vector with length (# of spectra + 1) giving the x positions
              along the slit of the slit apertures in pixel. The difference
              between the first and the last entry corresponds to the slit
              length. 
   4. ext.  : the image of the right panel window oversampled by Sampling.
   5. ext.  : the image of the slit. This image has the same dimensions as the
              extension 4.

   Using the data:
   The lines below show an example about how to use
   the data to plot pv-diagrams.

   a = readfits('test.fits',h)
   x = readfits('test.fits',ext=3)
   x = interpol(x,(n_elements(x)-1))
   CRPIX2 = sxpar(h,'CRPIX2')
   CDELT2 = sxpar(h,'CDELT2')
   CRVAL2 = sxpar(h,'CRVAL2')
   WAVE   = sxpar(h,'WUNIT') eq 'WAVE'
   nda = size(a)
   l   = (dindgen(nda(2))-(CRPIX2-1))*CDELT2+CRVAL2
   c   = 12345   ; here you have to define the center wavelength
   v   = WAVE ? ((l-c)*2.998D5/c) : (l-c)
   contour, a, x, v, /nodata, xst=1, yst=1
   tvimage, bytscl(a,min(a),max(a)),/overplot
   axis, xaxis=0,/xst,xtitle='[pixel]'
   axis, xaxis=1,/xst
   axis, yaxis=0,/yst,ytitle=(WAVE ? '[km/s]':'[Slice]')
   axis, yaxis=1,/yst



Plot PV diagram:
----------------
If you have extracted spectra from a slit (see 'Slit extraction') you can plot
a pv diagram directly from the main GUI (Tools->Plot PV diagram).
This starts the Fluxer PV Viewer GUI.

Parameters can be set in the left area of the GUI, the pv diagram is shown in
the middle, and the slit arrangement is shown to the right together with a
additional infos.

Parameters:
   Center wavelength  : Here you define the center wavelength in units as
                        specified. This wavelength corresponds zero velocity. 
   Minimum data value : The minimum data value to be plotted.
   Maximum data value : The maximum data value to be plotted.
   Oversampling       : The pv diagram can be oversampled to get smoother
                        pv diagrams.
   IDL colortable     : an IDL colortable index
   Image Scaling      : Either 
   	 	      	'Linear'  for linear image scaling
                        'Log'     for logarithmic image scaling
                        'Asinh'   for Asinh image scaling
   Quit               : Quits the GUI
   Write to PS        : Writes the pv diagram to a ps file.

This GUI is intended as a quick viewer. For more sophisticated plots, you find
a few IDL lines in 'Slit extraction' explaining how to read the data.
