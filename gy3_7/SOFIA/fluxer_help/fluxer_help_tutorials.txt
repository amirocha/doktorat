Tutorials and Quick guides :
----------------------------


        - Viewing spectra
        =================
        After you have loaded a data cube with fluxer the main GUI is
        started. In the two panel windows on the upper right of the main GUI
        the very first slice (image of constant wavelength) of your data cube
        is shown. To see the next slice click the rainbow colored double
        headed arrow in the top left of the main GUI with the right mouse
        button. To see the previous slice click the on the arrow with the left
        mouse button. Alternatively you can specify the index of the slice you
        want to view by entering it in the 'Slice Index' field on the top left
        of the main GUI. If wavelengths are specified you can also enter the
        wavelength in the 'Wavelength' field.

        If you move your mouse over any of the two panel windows the
        corresponding spectrum is shown below. On startup the maximum number
        of wavelength channels displayed is 100. If more channels are
        available in your data and you want to see all channels (e.g. the full
        spectral range) enter the number of channels to be displayed in the
        middle left of the main GUI 'X Range: Half # of slices in
        spectrum'. This specifies the number of channels to the left and to
        the right of the slice currently displayed in the panel window.


        - Zooming in the panel windows
        ==============================
        You can zoom into the slices in the panel windows by selecting 'Zoom'
        in the 'Panel Mouse Mode' section in the middle left of the main GUI.
        Click the left mouse button in any panel window and you zoom in, a
        right mouse button click zooms out, a middle mouse button click 
        recenters without changing the zoom level.


        - Changing colors, contrast, brightness etc.
        ============================================
        The colors of the in the panel windows displayed slices can be changed
        in various ways.
        Colortables : The colortable can be changed by selecting any from the
                      'Image Colors + Scaling -> Colortable' pulldown menu.
        Scaling     : The scaling can be changed by selecting any scale from
                      the 'Image Colors + Scaling -> Scaling'.
        Contrast and brightness : Select 'Color' as the 'Panel Mouse Mode' in
                      the middle left of the main GUI. Move the mouse over any
                      panel window click the left mouse button, keep it
                      pressed and move the mouse up and down and left and
                      right. This changes contrast and brightness. A right
                      mouse button click resets the default brightness and
                      contrast.
    

        - Setting min and max values for displaying slices
        ==================================================
        The minimum and maximum values to be displayed in the panel windows
        can be set by selecting 'Manual Min/Max' from the pulldown menu under
        any panel window. The min and max values apply only to that panel
        window. Those can be set by either clicking on the colorbar with the
        middle mouse button or click the colorbar with the left mouse button
        keep it pressed and move it up/down to increase/decrease the minimum
        value or use the right mouse button in the same way to change the
        maximum.


        - Setting the spectral extraction mode
        ======================================
        When moving the mouse over the panel window usually only one
        single spectrum is displayed. If you want to sum up spectra from an
        aperture, set the 'Cursor Size' in the top left of the main GUI. This
        specifies the half radius of the extraction aperture which is integer
        pixel based. E.g. if set to 1 the aperture has the form of a cross,
        the middle one and the left, right, top and bottom spectra. If you
        want circular apertures select any HighRes extraction mode from the
        'Cursor Mode' pulldown menu. 
 

        - Addtional keyboard actions for the panel windows
        ==================================================
        There are many actions available when clicking a key when the mouse is
        placed in any panel window. Move the mouse over any panel window and
        click the question mark to get a list of available keyboard
        actions. This list can also be displayed be selecting 'Help ->
        Keyboard actions' from the main menu bar. 


        - Line extraction
        =================

        Fitting one or two Gaussians to emission or absorpion line profiles:
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
        First you have to switch to a line extraction mode. Select
        e.g. GAUSSIAN from the 'Method' pulldown menu in the line fitting
        section. Now, move the cursor over the left panel window. The 
	corresponding spectrum will be displayed in the Plot window. To fit a
        function, data values have to be marked to which the baseline
        (baseline fitting regions) and the fit function (line fitting region)
        shall be fitted. The figure below illustrates the two different fit
        regions. 

        ^
      F	|
      l	|                  /\
      u	|                 /  \     Emission line in spectrum
      x	|                /    \
	|               /      \
	|--------------/        \-----------------------
	|
	| [       ] (              )  [              ]               
	|
	|------------------------------------------------> Wavelength

	[  ]  : baseline fitting regions
	(  )  : line fitting region
 

        To define these fit regions, press the left mouse button in the left
	panel window to lock the mouse. The effect is, that the spectrum does
	not change anymore when you move the mouse over any panel window.
        Now, have a closer look at the spectrum. Define the data ranges of the
	spectrum to which the baseline shall be fitted. Move the mouse to the
	Plot window, press the left mouse button, keep it pressed and move it.
        Releasing the left mouse button defines the data range. You can repeat
	this step as many times you want to e.g. either side of an emission
	line. Now, you have to define the data range for line
	extraction (data values to which the fit function shall be fitted after
        the baseline has been subtracted). Press the right mouse button keep
        it pressed, move it and release it. Now, the baseline and the
        requested fit function (gaussian) are fitted. You can delete a
        specific fit region by doing a middle mouse click within that fit
        region in the Plot window. All fit regions can be deleted by doing a 
        middle mouse click outside any fit region in the Plot window or by 
        selecting 'Reset Fit limits' from the 'Action' pulldown menu in the
        line fitting section of the main GUI. 

        When fitting a Gaussian you can select a second line fit region which
        fits a double Gaussian. In this case the data ranges can only be
        deleted by selecting 'Reset Fit limits' from the Action pulldown
        menu. The middle mouse button instead opens the parinfo editor which
        allows you to confine the allowed sigma values for fitting. Simply
        move the sliders. 

        Considering the case of fitting one gaussian only, you can now select
        the 'Fit all spectra' from the Action pulldown menu which fits all
        spectra in your cube with the defined data ranges. Take care, that due
        to dynamics of your source, the emission line is always within the
        data range defined for line extraction. Otherwise some fits may
        fail. You can have a look at the results by selecting any result from
        the pulldown menues under the panel images.


        Constraining line extraction to positive /negative values:
        ----------------------------------------------------------
        In all line fitting modes you can force Fluxer to apply 
        positive/negative (emission/absorption) peak fits only. 
        Additionally you can allow Fluxer to decide if the peak fit shall be
        positive or negative. 
        This can be done by opening the parinfo editor from the 
        'Line fitting->Action' pulldown menu.


        Extracting a telluric spectrum and removing intrinsic 
		   absorption lines :
        ----------------------------------------------------------
        In the near-infrared (e.g. in K-band around 2.2 micron) the 
        atmosphere is calibrated by taking data of O- or B- giants or 
        supergiants. Usually these stars exhibit hydrogen absorption 
        lines that falsify the result. 
	Set the cursor size to e.g. twice the FWHM of the stellar PSF.
        Center the cursor on the star and lock the mouse. Select as Cursor
        Mode 'HighRes Sum'. Now fit e.g. the Brackett gamma line in 
        absorption with a Lorentzian. Once you are happy with the fit,
	select 'Action->Save fit subtracted single spectrum' and the fit
        subtracted spectrum is saved as a fits file. Intensities are stored
	in the primary, wavelengths are stored in the first extension.


        Dividing all spectra by a telluric spectrum :
        ----------------------------------------------------------
        Select 'Calculus->Cube->Divide by spectrum'. Select the data 
	to be loaded, either Y values (intensities) only or X and Y values
        (wavelengths and intensities). Click 'Done'. Then specify the 
        the filename and load the X and Y values. If the X values do not
        correspod to the wavelengths of your cube, you can interpolate them
        onto your wavelength grid before division.



        - Astrometry
        ============

        Astrometry is only available if Fluxer gets a fits header with
        corresponding fits header keywords. A fits header is supplied by
        reading a fitsfile or using the header keyword from commandline:
        IDL>fluxer,mydata,header=h
        where mydata is your data matrix and h the corresponding header.
        Minimum requirement for astrometry is that the CRPIXi, CRREFi and
        CDELTi keywords (with i=1,2) are defined propperly. Additionally the
        equinox must be defined (e.g. EQUINOX=2000.0) and the type of the
        coordinate system (CTYPEi with i=1,2, e.g. CTYPE1='RA___TAN' and 
        CTYPE2='DEC--TAN'). 


        Measuring the angular distance between two spatial elements in the FoV:
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------
        If astrometry is well defined, select 'Profile' from the 'Panel Mouse
	Mode' section. A left click-hold-move draws the profile and gives info
	about the angular distance between the starting and current end point
	of the profile. The profile is shown in the plot
	window and can be analyzed in fluxer_plot1d after having released the
	left mouse button.
         
 
        Determine the angular resolution in stellar data cubes:
	-------------------------------------------------------
	First create a good image of your star by e.g. collapsing the data
	cube along the wavelength axis. This can be done by selecting
	'Collapsed' from the pulldown menu under the panel windows.

	Then, either extract a profile through the image of the star (see
	example above). The profile is shown in fluxer_plot1d. There you can
	fit the profile with a Gaussian. The width (sigma) is shown.
 	Or, press 'F' in the panel image that displays the collapsed data
	cube. That invokes another GUI that allows you to fit a 2-dimensional
	function to the image. 


	- Spatial healing
        =================
        Select a Spatial healing method e.g. Median 3x3, select 'Queue' in
        the 'Panel Mouse Mode' section and display a slice in the left and
        right panel window by selecting 'Slice' from the pulldown menues under
        the panel window. Move the cursor over the left panel window. 
	The corresponding spectrum will be displayed in the Plot
	window. Clicking the left mouse button marks a pixel, clicking
	the right mouse button unmarks it. 
	The way how marked pixels are interpolated is controlled by the
	method you have selected. A Spatial Method interpolates marked
        pixels with good pixels only of the same slice. It is 2-dimensional
	by definition. Available methods
	are: Median, Smooth, Plane, Second Order, Gauss,
	Bi-cubic spline and Chebyshef and SelfSim.
        Select any and see the result in the right panel window.
	Setting a Cursor Size greater than 0 allows larger areas to be queued
        or unqueued. Anytime a pixel is queued or unqueued for interpolation,
        the interpolation result is shown in the right panel window. The
        interpolation result is not yet accepted, you can change the
        interpolation method by selecting a method from the 'Method' pulldown
        menu in the 'Spatial healing' section. Once you are satisfied with the
        result you can accept the result as new input by healing it. This is
        done be selecting 'This', to heal all queued pixel in the currently
        displayed slice, or 'All', to heal all queued pixel in the data cube,
        from the 'Heal' pulldown menue in the 'Spatial healing' section.
