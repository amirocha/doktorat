Contours :
----------

Contours can be plotted in both panel windows independently by pressing 'Q'
when the mouse is within a panel window. Upon 'Q' the contour Creation dialog
is invoked.

If contours have already been plotted another dialog is invoked which allows
to change the current contour settings, apply new contours, remove contours
and so on.

When changing the image in the panel window, the countours remain unchanged.

In the Contour GUI which is launched you have to specify the method for
contour calculation. 
You can either select the number of contour levels together with a 
minimum and maximum value (1) or set contour levels in 1/2^n of the  
peak value (2) or set contour levels in % of the current 
peak value (3) or specify contour levels manually (4). 

(The minimum and maximum values shown here may not represent the true minimum
and maximum values in the image if sigma clipping for determining the min/max
values is applied.)

When contouring a slice of the data cube, only inside and not queued pixel are
used. When contouring a fit result, only fit results that are inside and
contain a valid fit result are used. When a viewing mask is defined
additionally the pixel must not be masked by the viewing mask.

To (1): Min-Max
- Calculation of contour levels : 
  min+(findgen(ncont)+1)*(max-min)/(ncont+1)
  Hence: max = 5 and min = 1 and ncont = 3 gives the following levels:
  2.00000      3.00000      4.00000
  The min and max values are never used as contour levels.

To (2): % of Peak
- Here percentages of the peak value can be used to determine contour 
  levels. Additionally, which peak value should be used, must be specified 
  (is the peak positive, use the maximum value as peak value, or 
   negative, use the minimum value as peak value).

To (3): Peak over power of 2
- Contour levels are calculated from a specified peak value:
  contour levels = peak value / 2^findgen(number of levels), hence 1/2, 1/4,
  1/8, 1/16 ,... 

To (4): Manual
Specify manually the contour levels. The list must be comma separated. E.g.
1,2,3 or 1.2,1.4,1.2e-2. The contour levels may be specified in arbitrary 
order.

For methods 1 and 4 you can additionally specify the label format
Allowed format codes: ab.c with a=E or F, b = total # of print characters, 
c = # of digits, E.g. F7.2


More parameter:
---------------

Indicate Downhill:
   The downhill direction can be indicated.

Level labeling:
   Can be switched on and off.

Line thickness, char size and char thickness can be set additionally.

Contour smoothing :
   The contour levels can also be smoothed using a median filter. The size of
   the median filter is 1 plus twice the value of the slider

Select a contour color:
   The contour colors can be specified in all cases and are independent 
   of which IDL colortable is used. Contour colors can be changed 
   anytime by pressing Q again.
