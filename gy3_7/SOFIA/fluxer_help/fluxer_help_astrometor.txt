This is the help page for fluxer_astrometor.

This tool allows to assign a fits coordinate system to JPG images and saves
the JPG image as a RGB fitsfile. The RGB fitsfile can also be aligned with
fluxer_aligner.

To assign fits coordinates you must have any fits image as reference.
Point-like objects can be fitted with a Gaussian in the fits image as well
in the JPG image. The known RA and DEC position from the Gaussian fitted in
the fits image are correlated with the fitted position of the same object in
the JPG image. After 3 positions have been determined the fits coordinate
system can be calculated. The input fits file can have any astrometry defined.
The final RGB fits file has always a tangential 'RA---TAN' astrometry (J2000)
as defined by the fits keywords: the CD matrix, CRPIX, CRVAL, CTYPE and
CDELT. Any distortions however defined in the fits image can not be 
transferred.
After having created the RGB fits file, it can be processed further e.g. by
fluxer_aligner.

The easiest way to obtain a fits image with astrometry as reference 
is to start fluxer_sdss from the IDL command line and download a fits image
from the DSS server. E.g. enter the object name in the 'Object Name' 
field, hit enter, hit 'Get image only' and hit 'Save Image'.

You can use any fits image with correctly defined astrometry. The fits image
can have any coordinate system, any equinox, any sampling and any position
angle. However, if the astrometry in your fits image is not set up correctly 
fluxer_astrometor may simply crash.
 

The GUI:
--------

Fluxer_astrometor shows the fits image in the left window and the jpg in the
right window. There are two mouse modes which allow either to zoom into an
image or fit a Gaussian to a pointlike object. The panel windows below show
the part of the image that shall be fitted with a Gaussian. The table to the
right shows the reference points.


Table of reference points:
--------------------------
X1 and Y1 (the X/Y positions in the fits image) with corresponding coordinates 
RA and DEC, X2 and Y2 the X/Y positions in the JPG image. The table can not be
edited. The last reference point added to the table can be deleted by clicking
'Delete Last'. If X2 and Y2 are not defined for a reference position X1/Y1 the
entry in the table is NAN. You always have to fit a position in the fits
image first and add it to the list of reference points before you can fit a
position in the JPG image.


Parameters :
------------

   'Load Fits File with Astrometry' : Loads a fits file with defined
            astrometry.

   'Load JPG File'  : Loads a JPG image.

   'Zoom Size'      : Sets the size of the image extracted from the original 
                      to be fitted with a Gaussian.

   The text area gives information about the current and fitted position

   'Mouse mode'     :

      There are two mouse modes and only one can be used at a time.
      'Zoom'     : 
      		 Left click   : zoom in
 		 Middle click : recenter
		 Right click  : zoom out

      'Fit'      :
       		 Left click   : Fit a Gaussian and indicate the FWHM of the
       		                fit as a red circle in the panel window. 
		 Right click  : Same as left click but additionally adds the
       		                fitted center to the list of reference points.

   'Image Scale'  : Allows to set the min and max values of the fits image to
                    get better plot results

   'Color Table'  : Allows to set the IDL colortable to display the fits image 
   	  	    only. 

   'Delete Last'  : Delete the last entry form the table of reference points.

   'Do'           : Creates the RGB fits file. Exactly three reference points
                    are needed

   'Help'         : Displays this help page.

   'Quit'         : Quits
