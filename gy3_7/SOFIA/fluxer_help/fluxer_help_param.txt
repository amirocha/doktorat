Here, a list of parameters that are directly available from the main GUI.

General parameters:
-------------------

      1. row: Slice and redshift selection
         Slice       : Number of the (current) slice to be displayed
                       (starting with 0)
	 Wave        : Wavelength of the slice to be displayed
	 Arrow image : Move a slice back (left click)
		     : Move a slice forward (right click)
         Z           : Opens a new dialog which allows to set redshift,
                       velocity or distance if wavelengths are
                       supplied. The Hubble constant which can be specified
                       here is not set as a preference. Use the Preference
                       Settings dialog instead.

      2. row: Cursor settings and Image colors and scaling
	 Cursor	Size : Half-Width of the cursor box. 
                       -Spatial healing mode, the cursor is rectangular. The
		        spectrum displayed is always the one spectrum of the
		        one pixel where the cursor is centered
                       -Wavelength healing mode, the cursor can not have a
		        greater size than 0 (means 1 pixel).
                       -Line fitting mode, all spectra within a circular
                        aperture around the current mouse position are averaged
		        or summed. 
         Cursor	Mode : Only for Line fitting mode. 
	 	       Average : All spectra within a circular aperture with
	 	       	       	 radius Cursor Size are averaged. The aperture
	 			 uses all pixels if the center of a pixel is
	 			 within the aperture. 
				 This mode provides error propagation if
				 errors are provided.  
                       Sum     : All spectra within a circular aperture with
	 	       	       	 radius Cursor Size are summed up. The aperture
	 			 only uses pixels if the center of a pixel
	 			 within the aperture is within the radius. 
				 This mode provides error propagation if
				 errors are provided. If one or more spexel in
	                         the aperture for a specific slice are
	 			 invalid, the resultant channel is invalid as
				 well. 
	 	       HighRes Average : All spectra within a circular
                         	 aperture with radius Cursor Size are
				 averaged. Pixels that are only partially
      	                         covered by the aperture will be used
	                         according to the fraction of coverage.  
				 This mode provides error propagation if
				 errors are provided.  
                       HighRes Sum     : All spectra within a circular aperture with
	 	       	       	 radius Cursor Size are summed up. Pixels that
	                         are only partially covered by the aperture
	 			 will be used according to the fraction of coverage.  
				 This mode provides error propagation if
				 errors are provided. If one or more spexel in
	                         the aperture for a specific slice are
	 			 invalid, the resultant channel is invalid as
				 well.  


      Image Colors and Scaling : A dialog for selecting the colortable or to
                                 do image scaling (see fluxer_color_scaling_help.txt)

      3. row : Panel Mouse Mode
      Here you can select the mouse mode that defines mouse button actions in
      the panel windows.  See "Help->Mouse Modes" from the main menu bar.


      4. row: Modes
      You may either select the spatial or the wavelength healing or
      line fitting mode. 


      5. row: Additional functionality

      Bad pixel search :
      Bad pixel search can be run on the currently selected slice or on all
      slices. Select the Help tag from the corresponding pulldown menues to
      get info about the search algorithm and parameters to be set.

      Calculus :
      Here you can median or boxcar filter or convolve with a gaussian PSF
      each slice of your data cube or many more. You can also reset queued
      pixels here.

      Viewing Masks :
      Allows to load/create and delete viewing masks. See "Help->Applying
      Viewing Masks" from the main menu bar.



Plotting parameters:
--------------------

   These are the plotting parameters that can be set from the main GUI

   X Axis Scaling:

      Half # of spectral channels to be displayed in the plot window : 
                            The Plot windows show the extracted spectrum 
                            between actual slice - # to actual slice + #

      Overplotted spectra get redshift corrected wavelengths : If Yes then the
                            wavelengths of overplotted spectra is transferred
                            to rest frame. If No then the wavelengths of
                            overplotted spectra are not transferred to rest
                            frame. This is useful for overplotting 
                            e.g. ATRAN transmission curves.

   Y Axis Scaling:

      Auto Data           : Scaling mode of the plot window. For scaling 
                            only valid pixel are used.
     		       	    Auto Data : Automatic scaling. The y-range is set
   	                             automatically in every spectrum to :
			   	     [min(data), max(data)]

     		       	    Auto Data+Fit : Automatic scaling. The y-range is set
   	                             automatically in every spectrum to 
                                     [min(data,fit),max(data,fit)]

   		       	    Auto Data+Error : Automatic scaling. The y-range is set
   	                             automatically in every spectrum to :
                                     [min(data-error),max(data+error)]

     		       	    Auto Data+Fit+Error : Automatic scaling. The y-range is 
   	                             set automatically in every spectrum to :
                                     [min(data-error,fit),max(data+error,fit)]

                            Manual : Allows to set the y-range manually with
      	                             the Min/MaxY values.

      Min/Max Y           : Min/Max y value to be plotted when scaling the plot window
                            manually. 

      Overplotted spectra get the same Y scale as the currently displayed : 
                                 If No then the overplots get their own Y
                                 scale (e.g. when overplotting ATRAN
                                 transmission curves).
                                 If Yes then the overplots Y range is
                                 determined together with the currently
                                 displayed spectra according to 'Auto Data'

 

   Line                : Increases or decreases the line thickness of the
                         plotted spectra or contours.
   Char                : Increases or decreases the charsize in plots.


Mouse Actions:
--------------
    Panel Windows :
    ---------------
    The action that is invoked by clicking a mouse button in one of the panel
    windows depends on the mouse mode. See Help->Mouse Modes


    Plot window :
    -------------
    When moving the cursor over one of the two panel windows, the corresponding
    spectrum which is extracted from an aperture with half-radius Cursor will
    be displayed in this window.  

    What do you see:
        In all modes : Pixels that are marked/outside are indicated with a
                       white/red diamond at the upper rim of the plot.

        Spatial healing : The spectrum of the current pixel as a histogram

        Wavelength healing : The spectrum of the current pixel. The data
	                     before interpolation as histogramm, the
	                     interpolated data as lines.

        Line fitting : Data used for fitting (white)
                       Fit (red)
                       Baseline fit (green)
                       Fit subtracted spectrum (blue)


    Possible actions: 
        Wavelength healing:
           Left-click   : marks a pixel and interpolates acc. to the selected
           		  wavelength healing method
           Right-click  : unmarks a pixel and interpolates remaining marked 
                          acc. to the selected wavelength healing method 

        Line fitting :
           Left-hold and move  : Defines the baseline fitting regions. You can
           	     	       	 select as many as you like.
                                 Baseline fitting regions can not be moved or
           			 resized. Baseline fitting regions may overlap
           			 but this has no additional effect.

           Right-hold and move : Defines the line fitting region. Only good
                                 pixels are used for the fit. Defining a
                                 second line fitting region (for a double line fit) is
                                 only possible when fitting GAUSSIANs.  

           Middle click        : deletes a fit region, if click occured in a
                                 fit region, or deletes all fit regions if
                                 click occured outside any fit region.

           Also baseline and line fitting regions are allowed to overlap.


    Colorbar window :
    -----------------
    Image scale set to 'Auto' :
    The colorbar and hence the minimum and maximum values to be displayed are
    determined automatically from the image displayed. When zooming in or out
    or recentering the image the image scale is kept fix. Any other action
    rescales the colorbar (and the minimum and maximum value). If you want to
    rescale the image while zooming or recentering, click on the corresponding
    colorbar. 

    Image scale set to 'Manual':
    A left/right click-hold and move within a colorbar changes the min and max
    value. A middle click invokes a GUI for manual value selection.


Info areas :
------------
Under the panel windows four info areas are located:

The top left shows the astronomical coordinates (as defined by the WCS menu in
the menubar of the main window) if an astrometric header has been found.
The top right info area shows the Method selected (in case of spatial
healing), the pixel index coordinates, an indicator that indicates the status
of the pixel the mouse cursor moves over (O: Outside, I: Inside, Q: queued for
interpolation) and the data values for the images in the left and the right
panel window when moving the mouse over a panel window. The middle info area
summarizes the found coefficients when line fitting. When fitting two
gaussians additionally the distance of the gaussian centers is printed. The
bottom info area shows information if wavelength healing or line fitting is
selected and when moving over the plot window. The fitting method, x and y
coordinate, pixel coordinate and which line identification is closest.  

Menu bar :
----------
The menu bar is located on top of the GUI.
    	- Do:

            Load cube 
	       Restarts Fluxer to load a new datacube from a fitsfile.

	    Save data
               Saves the data cube as a fits file. The primary contains the
               data cube, extension 1 contains the inside cube,
	       which is of the same size as the data cube with 1 if a pixel is
	       inside and 0 if outside.

            Save queued data
               Saves the queued data cube as a fits file. The primary contains
               a cube of same size as the data cube with 1 where pixels
               have been queued for interpolation and inside, 0
               otherwise. Extension 1 contains the inside cube,
	       which is of the same size as the data cube with 1 if a pixel is
	       inside and 0 if outside.

            Save continuum subtracted cube
               Saves the continuum subtracted (baseline subtracted) data cube
               as a fits file. Of course the baseline must have been
               determined from a line fit before.
               Extension 0 contains the baseline subtracted data cube, 
               extension 1 contains a cube with 1 where the line fit has been
               successful, 0 otherwise.

            Save fit results
               Saves the determined fit parameters in line fitting mode as fits
               files. See 'Fit Parameters and errors' in the 'Help' pulldown
               menu in the main menu bar. 

            Add Fits keyword
               Add a fits keyword to the header. If no header exists,
               create one.

            Delete Fits keyword
               Delete a fits keyword from the header, if it exists. If no
               header exists, nothing is done.

            Exit

            Get redshift from NED
               Given the name of the object, Fluxer contacts NED for the redshift. 
               If the fits header contains the OBJECT or the OBJ_NAME keyword, 
               that value is predefined in the GUI. If the name was resolved
               by NED and the redshift submitted by NED is valid, the user can
               set this redshift as active by pressing 'Set'. Note, that an active
               internet connection is required for this.

Keyboard events:
----------------
Depending on the window keyboard events are available:

NOTE: Some of the visualizations started by keyboard actions are displayed
wrong depending on the IDL version you use. It is an IDL bug that the scaling 
of the axes are wrong. Only the visualization is affected.

In the left panel window
  A: Open this image in fluxer_atv
  B: Calculate barycentric velocity offset from the fits header keyword
     DATE-OBS and the equinox specified in the header.
  C: Plot column of this image using fluxer_plot1d.
     Triangles on the upper rim indicate pixels queued for interpolation,
     rectangles pixel that are outside.
  D: Opens FLUXER DSS/SDSS to get DSS image and SDSS spectra.
     The image is retrieved for the coordinates specified by the current mouse
     position. If the Ra and Dec for the current mouse position can not be
     determined (astro header missing), you must specify the Ra and Dec. 
  E: Plot spectrum using fluxer_plot1d.
  F: Fit a gaussian or a moffat funtion to the image. The fit function always
     contains a baseline. As starting value for the center coords the mouse
     position where the 'F' keyboard event has been detected is used. In the
     next GUI you can specify:
     Fit function : the function to fit (GAUSS or MOFFAT)
     Fit symmetry : Either symmetric(=circular, /CIRCULAR
                    keyword to mpfit2dpeak) or asymmetric. 
                    If symmetric, the FWHM/HWHM are the same.
     Fit rotation : Allow rotation of the fit function (/TILT keyword to 
                    mpfit2dpeak).
     What to show : Either the fit result or the residual
     Show in      : The result is either shown in fluxer_atv (2D) or 
                    using isurface (in 3D)
  I: Show image statistics
  P: Calculate radial photometry and show it with fluxer_plot1d. In the next GUI
     you can specify:
     Radius of annuli                : radial increment of the annuli
     Sum or average over the annuli  : Either summing up all data values or
                                       divide by the area of the annuli for 
                                       averaging
     Use estimated center position   : the current center position (detected
                                       when having pressed 'P') and the
                                       estimated center position are printed
                                       above in this GUI. The estimated 
                                       center position is calculated according 
                                       to imcenterf written by M. Liu. 
  Q: Overplot contours
     Small tickmarks along the contour lines, mark the downhill direction.
     The GUI is self-explaining. Contours are plotted after having pressed
     'Done'. 'Remove' removes previously plotted contours from a panel
     image. 'Cancel' cancels contour plotting dialog. Contours are always only
     plotted for valid image elements.  
  R: Plot row of this image using fluxer_plot1d
     Triangles on the upper rim indicate pixels queued for interpolation,
     rectangles indicate pixel that are outside.
  S: Surface plot using iSurface
  W: Write image as PS, TIF (incl. contours and astrometry if requested), or
     FITS file. PS and TIF will contain the colorbar as well.
  1: Ask Simbad for object info
  2: Ask NED for object info
  3: Set currently selected spectrum as overplot
  4: Cancel overplotting
  Up/Right/Page up    : Show next slice
  Down/Left/Page down : Show previous slice
  ?: Show the available keyboard actions
