This is the help page for FLUXER_ALIGNER.

FLUXER_ALIGNER is a tool to regrid a set of fits files to a common grid and
allows to convolve them to the same angular resolution. The fits files must
contain valid astrometry (see below). Input files can have any angular
sampling, any position angle and an equinox of either 2000 or 1950.
The regridded data has always an equinox of J2000 and north up and east to the
left. 
FLUXER_ALIGNER can deal with images and with cubes. In case of cubes the
spatial axes must be the first and second one, the wavelength axis must be the
third. Input is always converted to double, output is always in
double. 

SPECIAL NOTES:
- Cubes have not been tested yet.
- The errors in the output images have not been tested.

This tool has been tested only for tangential WCS.

The core routine redistributes flux from the old grid to a new grid 
according to the overlap of pixels on the old grid with the new grid
according to the mode selected (see below).

Currently fluxer_aligner does not provide an error frame on output.


Please read this full help page before you start!


Input file format
-----------------

Either:

- Fitsfile contains extensions named 'FLUX' or 'FLX' and 'ERROR'
  or 'ERR'. These extensions are used as the data array and error
  array. This is compatible with FIFI-LS data
- Fitsfile contains a valid primary. This is used as the data
  array and the primary header is read. If the fitsfile has
  extensions, the first extension is used as the error array.
  If no extensions are available, no error array is used.
  This is compatible with FLUXER and fitsfiles with single
  images/cubes.
- Fitsfile does not contain a valid primary. If extensions are
  available, the first extension is used as data array. The header
  from the first extension is used. No error array is used.
  This is compatible with some other observatories.

Data and corresponding error values are considered as invalid if at least one
of them is not finite, the data is exactly 0. or the error is less
equal 0. 

All input files must have valid astrometry! 


Output file format
------------------
The output fits files have two extensions:
     primary      : the regridded data
     1. extension : the error after regridding, currently useless
     2. extension : the number of old pixels that contributed in
                    calculating the new pixel value 



Starting FLUXER_ALIGNER:
------------------------
Type on the IDL commandline: IDL>fluxer_aligner
To load another input image simply press the 'Load Image' button under 
the table. You can interpolate as many input images as you like. Simple
load another input image by pressing the 'Load Data' button under the 
table again. You can select more than one fits file in the dialog that 
opens. The input files must be fitsfiles with valid astrometry. Input 
files can have any position angle, any sampling and any equinox. If 
you want to delete files from the table, select the rows and press 
the 'Delete Image' button under the table. 


What is shown in the window and what mouse button actions are available :
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The window shows the alignment of the individual input images defined in the
table. The size of the FoV is chosen such that all images fit into the output
images. Whenever you load another image or delete an image from the table the
size is recalculated. 

The input images shown here do not show dead pixels and are not exactly 
representing the regridded image (rather a preview). Additionally frames
indicating the borders of the input images are plotted with a number to the
lower left that corresponds to the row in the table showing the filename.

See the 'Plotting parameters' section below for how to set plotting
parameters.

There are no mouse button actions for the window.


What is shown in the table and what columns can be edited:
----------------------------------------------------------
   Ref         : not editable, but clickable. 
                 Selects the reference data that is plotted last.

   File        : not editable, not clickable
                 The filename.

   FWHM ["]    : editable, not clickable
                 FWHM in arcseconds.
                 This parameter is used to adapt the angular resolution for
		 your output images.
                 If set to zero, no convolution is performed. If set to a
                 positive value the data after it has been regridded is
                 convolved with a Gaussian having this FWHM. Convolution is
                 done pixelwise and may take some time on larger images.
                 All new pixels that are invalid before convolution are
                 invalid after convolution as well. 

   Mode        :  not editable, but clickable. 

           SUM : for the new pixel, sums up all partially overlapping old
           pixels. For e.g. flux maps. Disadvantage is that you may have an
           intensity gradient at the borders of the new image. This is the
           default.

              Formula : fj = Sum over i (Aij*Fi)
                        ej = sqrt(Sum over i (Aij^2 *Ei^2))
              Aij : Percentage of the flux from an old pixel i that is
              redistributed to a new pixel j
              Fi : flux in old pixel i
              Ei : error in old pixel i
              ej : error in old pixel j 
              fj : flux in new pixel j


           SUM+FLL : like SUM but new pixel that have less than 99.9%
           coverage with old pixels are marked as invalid.     

              Formula : see SUM

           AVG : averages instead of summing up. No gradients at the border
           but flux is generally not conserved since the ratio of the pixel
           areas is not considered. So when the new pixels are e.g. ten times
           smaller the total flux invcreases by a factor of 100.

              Formula : Wij = Aij/Ei^2
                        fj = Sum over i (Wij*Fi) / Sum over i (Wij)
                        ej = sqrt(1./sum over i (Wij))
              Aij : Percentage of the flux from an old pixel i that is
              redistributed to a new pixel j
              Fi : flux in old pixel i
              Ej : error in old pixel i 
              fj : flux in new pixel j
              ej : error in new pixel j


           AVG+SCL : like AVG but the ratio of old pixels size to new pixel
           size is multiplied to the data (sort of flux conservation). 

              Formula : see AVG but scaling with ratio of input/outpixel size is
              applied. 

   Lon ["], Lat ["] : not editable, not clickable
                 The longitude and latitude, depending on the wcs used, 
                 of the center of each input image. 

   CDELT1 ["], CDELT2 ["] : not editable, not clickable
                 CDELT1 and CDELT2 as coded in each input image

   X/Y [px]    : Size of the input images in pixel.


   PA [deg]    : not editable, not clickable
                 The position angle of the input data.

   WCS         : not editable, not clickable
                 The type of the world coordinate system

   Equinox     : not editable, not clickable
                 The numeric equinox of the input image. The input images can have
		 an equinox of 2000 or 1950.

   Comment     : not editable, clickable
                 In case of cubes it shows the mean wavelength of the cube as
                 coded with the CDELT3 fits keyword.


Further parameters in the GUI :
-------------------------------

   Sampling [arcseconds] : Angular sampling of the output data in
                     arcseconds. Whenever you load or delete a file from the
                     table, the sampling is recalculated as the mean CDELT1
                     and CDELT2 of the input data. If you wish another
                     sampling, reenter it here.

  Output Filename suffix  : The output filename is the input filename with
                            this suffix appended. E.g. test.fits is the input
                            filename and the suffix is abs then the output
                            filename is test_abc.fits. The output directory is
                            the current working directory.

   Ignore All Errors : if Yes then all error data that may be available with
                       the data is ignored. if No the error data, if
                       available, is used.

  Debug                   : The regridded data are concatenated to form a
                            single cube that is shown in fluxer after
                            completion. In case of cubes the 
                            regridded cubes are collapsed along the wavelength
                            axis and this image is added to the cube. 


Once you have set these parameters can can start the regridding by hitting
the 'Do' button in the GUI.


Plotting parameters :
---------------------

The following parameters allow to control plotting the input images in the
window.

  IDL colortable   : Allows to load another IDL colortable [0...40]
                     The color of the image borders can not be changed.

  Number of colors : Number of color to use for plotting the input images in
                     the window. Higher numbers take longer. 

  Draw Images      : If set to 'No' only the input image borders are plotted.

  Image scaling    : Every input image get its own scaling in intensity when
                     plotted. if you want to apply the scaling of the
                     reference image to all images, select 'Reference' here. 
                     Any image scale clips out 2% of the most extreme values
                     to get better plotting results. This can not be changed.
