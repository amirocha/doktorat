This is the help page for the PS GUI. It helps to create postscript files
for images displayed in the panel windows. Note, that once you started the PS
GUI it is linked to the image displayed in the panel window from which the
PS GUI was invoked. To change to the other panel window, close the PS GUI and
invoke the PS GUI from the other panel window. While the PS GUI is open, you
can set the minimum and maximum value in the Main GUI, change contrast and
brightness, ...

If you have selected an output file, you can simply create a postscript file 
by pressing 'Create'.

If astrometry is available, the GUI allows you to print astrometric
information to the axes:

   RADEC  : Print RA and DEC
   Center : Print offsets to center position
   None   : Print the content of the 'X Title' and 'Y Title' fields

Additional Plots / Infos
   Colorbar : Plot the colorbar
   Info     : Annotate the center position of the FoV

If fitting mask are available (indicating if a fit has been performed
successfully or not after having fitted all spectra), this mask can be applied.
For fits that failed, the background color will be used.

Background Color : Select the background color for pixels where the fit failed
or where data is marked as invalid or queued for interpolation (left panel
window) or still queued for interpoolation (right panel window).

Axis thickness, Char Thickness and Char Size :
   Set the thickness of lines, the thickness of chars and the size of chars.

Use TrueType Font : If 'Yes' use truetype fonts instead. If 'No' not.
   Be aware that depending on the font, the format code differs for the
   titles. 

Plot Title : Title of the plot. IDL format codes are allowed.

Colorbar Title : Title of the colorbar. IDL format codes are allowed.

X Title, Y Title : Axis titles. IDL format codes are allowed.

Plot position : Device normal coordinates [x0,y0,x1,y1] for the Plot Area
                After a postscript file has been created, the normal
                coordinates displayed are updated. This allows e.g. to arrange
                the colorbar exactly. 

Colorbar Position : Device normal coordinates [x0,y0,x1,y1] for the Colorbar

Output File : The name of the output file. Not editable.

Create : Create the PS file.
Reset  : Resets the plotting parameters to default values
File   : Select a new output file.
Help   : Show this help page
Quit   : Quit this GUI
