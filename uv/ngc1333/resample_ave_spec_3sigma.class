set match 0		! take a tolerance of search ranges (in arcsec), 0 = exact ranges
find /all		! If the tolerance is absent, the default value is 2 arcsec.

set unit v

\set weight equal	!	Weighting to be used for summations - it is needed after convolution
					!	weighting type: TIME (default), EQUAL, or SIGMA (1/sigma**2)
					!	Sigma isn't recommended unless you just made a baseline fit before
					!	Equal weight behaves differently in AVERAGE and ACCUMULATE 
					!	(which produces the sum)
