clear	!	clear the window with plot

greg1\set plot landscape	!	Sets the physical size of plot page: 'landscape' (default) 
							!	and 'portrait' have A4 format (30x21 cm), whereas 'square' 
							!	gives 30x30 cm plot page.

set viewport 0.065 0.9 0.1 0.925!	Defines the position of the box in terms of fraction 
								!	of the plot page size in X (Px1, Px2) and Y (Py1, Py2).
								!	The full command is: set viewport Px1 Px2 Py1 Py2
								!	Default is 0.150 0.925 0.125 0.925

greg\set coord user	!	Sets the coordinate system for DRAW ('box', 'character' or 'user')
					!	Default is: box 0

greg\set character 0.6	!	Set the character size (font size of x/y labels and tick-marks). 
						!	Default is 0.6
 
greg\pen /colour 0	!	Modify the current pen colour
					!	0: foreground -> resolves as black on white devices and reversely
					!	1: red
					!	2: green
					!	3: blue
					!	:
					!	7: background -> resolves as white on white devices (and black on black)
					!	The full comm. is: greg/pencil [N] [/color C] [/dashed D] [/weight W] [/defaut]
					!	N: it means pen number N
					!	C: colour (look above)
					!	D: pattern of line (1-7, 1: solid, 2 short dashed, 3: dotted, etc.)
					!	W: thickening factor of line (1-5)
					!	/DEFAULT: this option resets the default setting of the attributes, which
					!	are not specified

greg\box p o  i		!	Put axes around the plot region, labelling the lower and left ones.
					!	The full command is: greg\box Arg1 Arg2 Arg 2
					!	Arguments (Arg1-3) can be used to customize the ticks and labels:
					!	Arg1, Arg2: modify the labelling of the lower and left axes respectively
					!	The may take the P values for parallel (default for X axis), O for 
					!	orthogonal labels (default for Y axis) or N for no labels (preserving 
					!	the ticks)
					!	Arg3: indicates that the ticks are to be IN or OUT of the box or not 
					!	drawn at all (NONE). Disabling ticks also disable labels.
					!	BOX N N N: makes a rectangle with the current pen.

greg\label "\GD\Ga (Arcsec) " /x	!	Name of X label (RA)
greg\label "\GD\Gd (Arcsec) " /y	!	Name of Y labels (Dec)

set unit v ! I added this after making a convolution, because without this the grid map was empty!
set mode x -18 25	!	Zoom in X axis (velocity)         
set mode y -1 6.0	!	Zoom in Y axis

map /grid /nolabel	!	Plot a grid map, but without labels (they have been created already)

sys "rm -f 13co65_grid_conv.eps"	!	Remove the old .eps file
hardcopy "13co65_grid_conv.eps"		!	Save the new plot as .eps file
