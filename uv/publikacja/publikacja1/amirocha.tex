to their immediate surroundings. Detection of the line wings in CN profiles 
suggests that at least some emission is produced in the outflows, likely as a product 
of HCN photodissociation. The ratio of CN to HCN total column densities ranges from 
1 to 10 corresponding to G$_0$ $\approx$ $10^{1}-10^{3}$ for gas densities and

{UV radiation is identified towards both protostar and outflow positions. Its strength is corresponding with a \textbf{higher} end of the range determined from \textit{Herschel} observations.

\section{Introduction} 
\label{section:intro}


Formation of low-mass stars is associated with many physical phenomena. The inside-out collapse of dense envelopes
is accompanied by the ejection by bipolar outflows and the formation of embedded disks \citep{Fra14,Har15}.
Ultraviolet (UV) radiation can be produced in mass accretion on the central object or bow shocks and irradiates the outflow cavities 
in the envelopes \citep{Spa95,vKe09a}. The physical conditions and chemical 
composition in star forming regions strictly depend on the characteristics of the above processes. 

The importance of UV radiation for star formation was initially only considered in the context 
of the formation of massive stars, where central stars are the main source of UV photons from early stages \citep{Ces05,ZY07}. 
Detail chemical models of the envelopes and outflows with radiative transfer in 1 and 2D have been
developed for high-mass protostars \citep{DN97,Sta05,Bru07}. The far-UV radiation dissociates and ionizes molecules and
atoms with ionization potentials below 13.6 eV; more energetic photons are easily absorbed 
in the surrounding interstellar medium \citep{Ger16}. Among the most useful diagnostics
of the UV field in dense envelopes are abundances of hydrides and the column density ratio of CN and HCN \citep{Sta07}. 
The corresponding UV field strengths are enhanced by at least 1-2 orders of magnitude
compared to the interstellar radiation field and impact gas at temperatures of few hundred K \citep{Sta07,Ben16}. Yet, the CN and HCN ratio have not been used to probe the UV radiation in the envelopes of low-mass protostars so far.

%=================================================

In the environment of low-mass protostars, the possible role of UV radiation was detected in narrow $^{12}$CO 6-5 lines spatially associated with outflow cavities in HH 46 \citep{vKe09b}. 
Firm detection of [C{\,\sc{i}}] 2-1 at the tip of the HH 46 jet and the lack of CO was attributed 
to the presence of dissociative bow shock capable of producing extra UV photons \citep{ND89}. 
Their transport on $\sim$1000 AU scales is facilitated by the low densities and
scattering in the outflow cavities \citep{Spa95}. Similar signatures of UV radiation 
were observed in a dedicated APEX-CHAMP$^+$ survey of $\sim$20 protostars \citep{Yil12,Yil15}. 
% $G_\mathrm{0}$ 50-300 in HH 46
%is a few hundred times the standard interstellar field (G0 50-300, where
%corresponds to the average local interstellar radiation field, about 108
%photons cm−2 s−1, Habing 1968).

Far-infrared observations with \textit{Herschel} provided access to CO lines with $J_\mathrm{u}$ up to 49,
and resulted in the detection of new hydrides, e.g. OH$^+$ \citep{Wyr10} and 
H$_2$O$^{+}$ \citep{Oss10}. As part of the `Water in star-forming regions with \textit{Herschel}' 
\citep[WISH,][]{vDi11} key program, a statistically significant sample of low-mass protostars 
was surveyed with the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far-Infrared \citep[HIFI,][]{dGr10} 
and the Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer \citep[PACS,][]{Pog10}. Among the key 
findings are: (i) ubiquitous gas at temperature of $\sim$300 K with molecular signatures
resembling shocks \citep{Her12,Goi12,Kar13,Kar18}; (ii) a consistently low abundance of H$_2$O of $\sim$$10^{-6}$ \citep{Kri17}; 
(iii) high abundances of the products of H$_2$O photodissociation and other hydrides, in particular OH \citep{Wam13,Ben16}; 
(iv) velocity-resolved components in H$_2$O profiles arising close to the protostar, at the 
positions of hydrides \citep{Kri13}; (v) ratios of H$_2$O/OH and CO/OH consistent with UV-irradiated shock models \citep{Kar18}.
These results confirm the presence of UV photons in the immediate surroundings 
of low-mass protostars. 

In this paper, we analyse large-scale maps in HCN and CN as alternative tracers of UV 
photodissociation toward Serpens, a low-mass star-forming region, in order to address the following 
questions: What is the morphology and spatial extent of the regions affected by UV radiation? 
Are there systematic differences in the ratios of CN and HCN between protostar and outflow positions? 
Does chemical models validate the utility of this ratio as a tracer of UV-irradiated gas 
in low-mass star-forming regions? What is the typical strength of UV radiation in Serpens determined
from CN and HCN, and how it compares to the results from \textit{Herschel}? 

The paper is organized as follows: Section~\ref{section:observations} describes the Serpens Main region and its protostars, the observations and
data reduction. Section~\ref{section:results} show the submillimetre maps and the line profiles at selected positions.
Section~\ref{section:analysis} shows the determination of molecular column densities and their comparisons to the chemical model. Section~\ref{section:discussion} discusses the results in the context of complementary studies and 
Section~\ref{section:conclusions} presents the summary and conclusions.

\subsection{Serpens as a low-mass star-formation site}
\label{subsection:serpens}


The Serpens is a well-studied low-mass star-forming region located at the 
distance of 436$\pm$9 pc \citep{Ort17}. The identification and classification of young 
stellar objects (YSOs) was done in the region as part of the \textit{Spitzer} ‘From Molecular Cores to
Planet-forming Disks’ (c2d) survey \citep{Har07,Eno09,Eva09,Dun15}. 
Submillimetre sources were studied using continuum observations at 12, 25, 60, 100 $\mu$m \citep{Hur96}, 800, 1100, 1300 and 2000 $\mu$m \citep{Cas93} and 3 mm \citep{Tes98}. The outflow activity in the Serpens Main was characterized using CO 2-1 \citep{Dav99}, and 
more recently with CO 3-2 and CO 6-5 for a subsample of sources (\citealt{Gra10}, \citealt{Dio10}, \citealt{Yil15}). Ser SMM1, SMM3 and 
SMM4 were observed with \textit{Herschel} as part of the WISH and `Dust, Ice, and Gas in Time' 
\citep[DIGIT,][]{Gre13,Gre16,YL18} programs. 

Figure 1 shows the continuum map at 250 $\mu$m corresponding to the region we observed with 
IRAM 30 m. The map was obtained with the \textit{Herschel} Spectral and Photometric Imaging 
REceiver (SPIRE; \citealt{Gri10}) as part of the ‘\textit{Herschel} Gould Belt Survey project' (\citealt{And10}). 

For the purpose of our analysis, we re-calculated spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for 
all protostars in the region using the continuum measurements at 70, 160 , 250, 350 and 500 $\mu$m 
from PACS and SPIRE covering the peak of the SEDs and following the procedures outlined in (\citealt{And10}, \citealt{Kir13}, \citealt{Kon15}).
\textbf{Figure~\ref{seds} and Table~\ref{SED_data} present} the SEDs of the protostars and providesnflux densities at each wavelength. Table~\ref{table:2} shows the bolometric luminosities
and temperatures, and the classification of the sources based on \citet{Eva09}.

\subsection{Observations and data reduction}
\label{subsection:data}
%=================================================
The observations at IRAM 30 m were performed between 14 and 17 July 2009 as part of the project ‘HCN/CN as UV-tracers in YSO envelope-outflow interfaces’ (PI: L. Kristensen). The Eight MIxer Receiver (EMIR) bands E090 and E150 covering the frequency ranges 73-117 GHz and 125-184 GHz were used to observe HCN 1-0, CN 1-0 and CS 3-2. The broad frequency ranges of EMIR facilitated additional detections 
of C$^{34}$S 3-2, H$^{13}$CN~\mbox{1-0} and H$^{13}$CN 2-1. The
backend was the Versatile SPectrometer Array (VESPA) autocorrelator and the 1 MHz filterbank
reaching the spectral resolution of 39 kHz (E150 band) and 78 kHz (E090 band).
Table~\ref{table:lines} shows the full list of molecular transitions observed with EMIR with 
respective beam sizes and the main beam efficiencies ($\eta_{\mathrm{MB}}$) used to convert antenna temperatures 
to the main beam temperatures ($T_{\mathrm{MB}}$). 

The OTF mode was used to obtain two 5$^{\prime}\times5^{\prime}$ maps centred at ($\alpha_\mathrm{J2000}$,$\delta_\mathrm{J2000}$)=18$^h$29$^m$49.6$^s$,
+01$^{\circ}$15$^{\prime}$20.5$^{\prime\prime}$, and 18$^h$29$^m$56.6$^s$, +01$^{\circ}$14$^{\prime}$00.3$^{\prime\prime}$. 
The merging and data reduction were carried out with the CLASS package within GILDAS\footnote{See
http://www.iram.fr/IRAMFR/GILDAS}. For the sake of analysis, the EMIR spectra were
baseline-corrected and resampled to a resolution of 0.5 km/s. The rms of extracted spectra varies from 0.024 K to 0.125 K. Figure \ref{iram_maps} shows the size and extent of the maps after the merging of two datasets and beam convolution.

The CHAMP+ dual-beam heterodyne receiver on the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) telescope used for CO 6-5 observations at 691.5 GHz was originally presented in \cite{Yil15}. The observations were performed on 16 June 2009 using position-switching in on-the-fly mapping mode resulting in maps covering 340$^{\prime\prime}\times 340^{\prime\prime}$. The Fast Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FFTS) was used as the backend with a resolution of 0.079 km s$^{-1}$ \citep{Kle06}. Typical value of rms is $\sim$0.018~K. 
Similarly, observations of the Ser SMM1 protostar in C$^{18}$O were obtained with the APEX/CHAMP+ on 23 October 2009. The data reduction and analysis were performed in a similar way to the IRAM observations using the CLASS software.

\section{Results} 
\label{section:results}

In the following sections, we present IRAM 30~m maps and line profiles 
providing complementary information about the emission from 
protostars and their outflows, and large-scale cloud emission.
Differences in spatial extent reflect the range of gas and dust 
distributions, and associated physical conditions and processes. 
We calculate ratios of various transitions to 
\textbf{indicate} species tracing similar physical components, the gas temperature,
and line opacities.

%=================================================
Figure \ref{iram_maps} shows the line emission associated with protostars and their outflows in HCN, CN and CS lines obtained with EMIR on IRAM 30~m and CO with CHAMP$^+$ on APEX. 
The emission in HCN and CN is the sum of all hyperfine components detected in the spectra 
(see Figure \ref{SMM4spectra}). Maps in additional transitions are presented in Appendix B.

HCN 1-0 emission is associated with clusters of protostars 
in the south-east and north-west parts of the map where dust emission at 250 $\mu$m is also detected (Figure 1). 
The emission peaks are the strongest at the positions of Ser SMM4 and SMM9 protostars and their outflows,
and significantly weaker at Ser SMM1 and SMM3. Qualitatively, the pattern of emission in
HCN is similar to the CO 6-5 - the well-established outflow tracer (Figure 2; bottom right panel). 
This results is in agreement with previous surveys of HCN in low-mass protostars \citep{Bac01,Wal14}.
Any differences between HCN and CO likely stem from the higher critical density of the 
\mbox{HCN 1-0} ($\sim$$10^6$ cm$^{-2}$), its lower upper energy level (see Table 2), and its 
significantly easier photodissociation due to UV photons than CO (see Section~\ref{section:discussion}). 

CS 3-2 emission shows a very similar spatial distribution to HCN 1-0 and CO 6-5, with most 
prominent structures associated with Ser SMM4. Some differences are seen mostly in the 
surrounding of Ser SMM9, where CS emission is substantially weaker at the Ser SMM9 position 
than in Ser SMM4, in contrast to HCN which shows similar line strengths towards both protostars. 
Additionally, CS shows a relatively strong emission to the west of Ser SMM9, which coincides 
with the outflow from that protostar. The differences may result from CS tracing warmer, yet lower-density gas ($n_\mathrm{crit}\sim$$10^5$ cm$^{-3}$).

In contrast to HCN and CS, CN 1-0 emission is associated more closely with the positions of protostars
and the continuum peaks at 250 $\mu$m, and not the outflows (Figures 1 and 2). The emission is the strongest at
Ser SMM4, SMM3, and SMM6, and the region in between these three protostars. The differences in 
spatial extent between CN and the outflow tracers suggest a different physical origin (see \textbf{Section~\ref{subsection:extent}}).

%=================================================
\subsection{Detection rates and line profiles}
\label{subsection:lines}
%=================================================
To explore gas properties in Serpens, we selected 10 protostellar positions and 5 
outflow positions for more in-depth analysis (see Tables 1 and 2, and Figure 2). Figure \ref{SMM4spectra} shows 
line profiles of targeted species and transitions toward Ser SMM4 and its outflow. Appendix~C shows the line profiles in the remaining positions. 

All targeted species and their isotopologues are detected in each position 
towards the protostars in Serpens, except the H$^{13}$CN 2-1 which is detected only in Ser SMM4 and Ser SMM9. Similarly, emission in the outflow 
positions is always detected in HCN, CS, CN and CO. Considering the targeted lines isotopologues, detections are seen in C$^{34}$S 3-2 , H$^{13}$CN 1-0, but not in H$^{13}$CN 2-1.
In case of HCN and CN, up to 3 and 5 components are detected as the result of the hyperfine splitting, respectively. 

The line shapes at both protostar and outflow positions show a relatively broad profiles, 
with outflow wings in CS extending of 13.6 km s$^{-1}$ and 9.8 km s$^{-1}$ at Ser SMM4 
source and outflow, respectively (Figure \ref{SMM4spectra}). Clearly, the beam sizes of 
IRAM encompass a substantial amount of outflow emission even at the protostar position. 

In order to quantify the emission in the line wings, we use the line profile of C$^{18}$O 6-5
for Ser SMM1, which is a good envelope tracer \citep{Arc06}. The profile extends from 
7.8 to 9.4 km s$^{-1}$ - the velocity ranges we exclude for the intensity integration of our line profiles. The outer velocity ranges for each of the profiles are calculated 
for each line separately based on the measured rms and the 2$\sigma$ signal. Appendix D shows the calculated intensities for all selected positions.

In the case of Ser SMM4 (Figure \ref{SMM4spectra}), the emission in the line wings
of CS 3-2 is 61\% of the total profile 
in the protostar position and 72\% in the outflow position. Similar characteristics is 
seen in HCN line wings (48\% and 68\%, respectively). In contrast, CN 1-0 is detected 
mostly at source velocity, with only 40\% of emission in the line wings. Among all 15
positions, exceptionally broad line wings in HCN and CS are detected in 
the Ser SMM1, Ser SMM9 and Ser SMM10 protostar positions and outflow positions 
nr 1, 4, and 5, exceeding 70\% of the total profile in HCN and 58\% in CS.

The shapes of line profiles clearly indicate that the emission in various species is 
detected in different physical components of the protostellar systems. For the
forthcoming analysis, we will consider the emission in the line wings alone and in 
the fully integrated profiles separately.

%=================================================
Table 3 shows the molecular line ratios at protostar and outflow positions in Serpens 
calculated separately for the fully integrated profiles and for the line wings. 
Here, we will discuss the results for (i) the ratios of different isotopologues, informing 
about the line opacities, (ii) the ratio of two transitions of H$^{13}$CN,
indicating gas temperature, (iii) ratios of different species, reflecting 
their relative abundances.

%==============================================================
\subsubsection{Ratios of different isotopologues}
\label{subsection:isotopologues}

%==============================================================
The line ratio of the same transition of two isotopologues can be used as a line opacity tracer 
of the more abundant species, assuming that the emission in the 
other isotopologue is optically thin. We adopt a standard method described in \cite{Gol84} 
to determine the line opacities of HCN 1-0 and \mbox{CS 3-2} lines, both in the protostar 
and outflow positions. We assume that both isotopologues arise from the 
same physical region, described by the excitation temperature, $T_\mathrm{exc}$, and 
in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). Using Equation~\ref{eq1}, we obtain
the values of 0.3-5.7 and 0.3-4.8 for the fully-integrated line profiles of HCN and CS with their isotopologues respectively.
\begin{equation} 
\label{eq1} \frac{T_{\mathrm{HCN}}}{T_{\mathrm{H^{13}CN}}} =
\frac{X[\mathrm{HCN}]}{X[\mathrm{H^{13}CN}]} \frac
{1-\exp(-\tau_{\mathrm{HCN}})}{\tau_{\mathrm{HCN}}} 
\end{equation} 

In this expression $\tau_{\mathrm{HCN}}$ is the optical depth of HCN, $X_{\mathrm{i}}$ refers to the abundance of an isotopologue and $T_{\mathrm{i}}$ to the antenna temperatures. For comparison, the expected ratio in case of optically thin emission is 30 and 20 for the ratio of HCN and H$^{13}$CN \citep{Dan13}, and the ratio of CS and C$^{34}$S \citep{Ter10}. Thus,
the emission in both species is optically thick when the entire
profile is considered. In contrast, the ratio of HCN and H$^{13}$CN
in the line wings is in the range from about 10 to 40, with the
exception of Ser SMM8, corresponding to optical depths of 0.6-
2.6 (see Table~\ref{table:CN/HCN}). Similarly, the line ratio of CS and C$^{34}$S is 5-20,
corresponding to $\tau \approx 0.8-2.6$. Thus, high-velocity emission of
HCN and CS in the outflow wings at both protostar and outflow
positions is basically optically thin.

An alternative method of calculating optical depth
uses the ratios of various hyperfine split components, yet for HCN this method shows considerable anomalies
\citep{Lou12}. Therefore, we apply it only
for the three strongest components of CN, F=3/2$\rightarrow$1/2, F=5/2$\rightarrow$3/2, F=1/2$\rightarrow$1/2, which optically thin ratios are
0.1235:0.3333:0.0988 \citep{Ska83}. The optical
depths of observed emission vary from 0.4 to 1.6 in protostar
position and from 0.2 to 1.0 for outflow positions is consistent
with the values obtained for HCN and CS. Qualitatively,
they are also in agreement with simple calculations using 1D
non-LTE radiative-transfer code RADEX \citep{vdT07}. Here, adopting hydrogen density of $10^5$ cm$^{-3}$ and kinetic temperature of the gas of 50 K, results in the optical
depths of 4.4 for HCN 1-0 and 2.1 for CS 3-2, assuming column densities of $3 \times 10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ for HCN and $5 \times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$ for
CS.

%It is seen that both the HCN and CN lines are optically thick so the calculated column densities can
%be underestimated by up the order of magnitude. Nevertheless, while both lines are similarly thick,
%this will have little effect on the relative values of calculated column densities.

%==============================================================
\subsubsection{The H$^{13}$CN 2-1/1-0 ratio}
\label{subsection:temperature}

%==============================================================
The H$^{13}$CN 2-1 emission is detected only in Ser SMM4 and Ser~SMM9, with the ratio of 1.98 and 1.31, respectively.
Using two transitions of the same molecule, the excitation temperature is calculated using Equation~\ref{eq2}, where $E_i$ refers to the energy of a level
and $n_i$ refers to population of upper and lower level.

\begin{equation} 
\label{eq2} 
T_{\mathrm{ex}} = \frac{E_u - E_l}{k \ln \frac{n_l}{n_u}} 
\end{equation}

The excitation temperature is 2.43 K and 2.77 K for Ser~SMM4 and Ser SMM9, respectively. 
These values are much lower than expected in envelopes and outflows of low-mass protostars. In particular,
gas temperatures in Ser SMM1, 3, and 4 calculated using multiple lines of $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O are 40-60 K 
and $^{12}$CO are 70-100 \citep{Yil12,Yil13}. The disagreement with our observations likely 
results from the low signal-to-noise of the H$^{13}$CN 2-1 line. 

%=================================================
\subsubsection{Ratios of different species}
\label{subsection:statistics}

%=================================================
The median value of the CN and HCN ratio at the protostars positions is $0.63 \pm 0.19$. Taking into account the emission in wings only the ratio is lower: $0.40 \pm 0.18$. The ratio calculated for the outflow positions equals $0.51 \pm 0.20$ and $0.24 \pm 0.20$ (derived from full profile and wings respectively). 
The CN and HCN ratio varies between 0.13 at the Outflow 3 to 0.85 at the Ser SMM3. 

There is no significant dependence between the CN and HCN ratio and the evolutionary stage of a source. The ratio for the
Class 0 protostars is $0.61 \pm 0.23$ and for the Class I protostars is $0.67 \pm 0.17$. Similarly, the median for the wings emission is $0.40 \pm 0.19$ irrespectively of the class of protostars.

%=================================================
\section{Analysis}
\label{section:analysis}

%=================================================
In this section, we calculate column densities of the molecules with the radiative-code RADEX and compare them to the results from the chemical-code Nahoon, 
run for a set of gas temperatures, densities and UV radiation fields. 
%============================================================
\subsection{Column densities of molecules from observations}
\label{subsection:column_densities}

%============================================================

In case of optically thin lines and LTE conditions, the column density of the 
upper level of a given molecule, $N_\mathrm{u}$, can be calculated using Equation~\ref{eq3}, where $\beta$ is a constant equal to 1937 cm$^{-2}$, $W$ is the integrated
intensity of the emission line ($\int{T_{mb} \, dV}$), and $\nu$ is a transition 
frequency between an upper and a lower level expressed in GHz. 

In order to calculate the total column density of a given molecule, 
we adopt a gas temperature of 75 K (see Section~\ref{subsection:temperature}). Equation~\ref{eq4} takes into account the 
temperature-dependent partition function $Q$($T$) for a given molecule, and 
the upper level energies ($E_\mathrm{u}$) and level degeneracies ($g_\mathrm{u}$);
$k_\mathrm{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant. Appendix E shows column densities obtained for all molecules, both at the protostars and the outflow positions.


\begin{equation} 
\label{eq3} N_\mathrm{u} = \beta \, \frac{\nu \,W}{A} 
\end{equation} 
\begin{equation} 
\label{eq4} N_\mathrm{tot} = Q(T_\mathrm{exc}) \, \exp(\frac{E_\mathrm{u}}{k_\mathrm{B} \, T_\mathrm{exc}}) \frac{N_\mathrm{u} }{g_\mathrm{u} } 
\end{equation} 
%The column densities of the upper level of CN $J=1_{3/2}-1_{1/2}$ and HCN $J=1-0$ transitions are presented in
%Table~\ref{table:fluxes}. The lowest transition of CN is more abundant molecule than the lowest
%transition line of HCN at the low-mass protostars positions. The column density of CN $J=1_{3/2}-1_{1/2}$ varies
%between 10$^{14}$ -10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$, while in the column density of the HCN’s lowest transition
%reaches 10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$. In the case of Ser-SMM2, Ser-SMM3, Ser-SMM4, Ser-SMM6 and Ser-SMM12 HCN
%$J=1-0$ line column density is an order of magnitude lower than the column density of the equivalent
%CN transition. This result provides a clue to better understand of the low-mass protostars
%chemistry.

Because of the optical thickness of HCN (Section~\ref{subsection:isotopologues}), we also employ the non-LTE radiative transfer code RADEX 
to obtain independent determinations of the column densities. In order to mimic the optically thin case,
for the calculations we adopt the HCN column density of 10$^8$ cm$^{-2}$. We vary the column density 
of CN from 10$^6$ to 10$^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$. The typical physical conditions of the gas 
in low-mass star forming regions are: number densities, $n_\mathrm{H}$ of the order of $10^{4}$-$10^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$ 
and kinetic temperature $T_\mathrm{kin}$ of 30-200 K \citep{Mot14}. Table~\ref{RADEX_Ns} shows the ratios of the calculated 
column densities of CN and HCN for these different sets of parameters, and assuming a line width of 1.0 km s$^{-1}$, separately for protostars and outflows positions.

The models are a mean to translate the observed line ratios of CN and HCN into column densities ratios. 
Figure \ref{model} shows the model calculated for the density of $10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$ and kinetic temperature 
of 200 K, typical for outflows in low-mass protostars (\citealt{vKe09b}, \citealt{Yil15}). Similar models are calculated for other sets of 
temperatures and densities, and the determined scaling factors between the intensity and column
density ratios show a very weak dependence on the adopted physical parameters (Appendix E). The observed line intensity ratio (full profile) 
in logarithm ranges from -0.62 to -0.07 and from -0.87 to -0.24 for protostars and outflow positions, respectively.
The corresponding column density ratio is
in the range 0.12 to 1.05 and -0.14 to 0.88. The resulting 
column density ratios of CN and HCN are in order of 1-10.

\end{figure}
%=================================================
The Nahoon chemical code is used to calculate theoretical abundances of 
molecules for a set of physical conditions and UV field strengths; it is a well-known
almost purely gas-phase chemical code for astronomical applications (\citealt{Wak15}). 

The Nahoon solver computes the chemical evolution in time including 489 species
and 7509 gas-phase and gas-grain reactions based on rate coefficients from the Kinetic
Database for Astrochemistry (KIDA) database\footnote{http://kida.obs.u-bordeaux1.fr/}. 
%The Nahoon code can model chemistry at a fixed temperature and density (0D modelling), as well as at grid of temperature, density and visual extinction (1D modelling). 

The UV radiation in Nahoon is described through the relation
between visual extinction $A_\mathrm{V}$ and the photodissociation rate coefficient $k$
(Eq.~\ref{eq5}). Here, $\mathrm{\alpha}$ and $\mathrm{\gamma}$ are the coefficients
of photodissociation for HCN, equal to $1.64\times10^{-9}$ and $3.12$, respectively \citep{Hea17}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq5} 
k = \alpha e^{-\gamma A_\mathrm{V}} 
\end{equation} 

In our analysis we used the latest version of Nahoon code (Nahoon\_kida.uva.2014). 
The evolution of the chemical network starts at the time of a dense cloud formation.
Figure~\ref{starless} shows a model corresponding to a typical dense cloud with temperature of 10 K
and hydrogen total density of $n_\mathrm{H} = 10^4$ cm$^{-3}$. The chemical composition
of the CN, HCN and CS molecules becomes stable after $10^{7}$ yr; the HCN abundance is higher
than that of CN. Assuming that star-formation begins at $t = 10^6$~yr in a dense cloud, we use model abundances for all 489 species at this time as an input data for the forthcoming set of models.

The closest neighbourhood of low-mass protostars is simulated based on the initial abundances of
all species from starless cloud modelling. We adopt the cosmic-ray ionization
rate of $1.3\times 10^{17}$ s$^{-1}$ \citep{Cra78}. The sets of models are run
for the temperature range between 10 and 200 K and the total hydrogen densities from $10^4$
cm$^{-3}$ to $10^6$ cm$^{-3}$. 

Figure \ref{AV5} shows the model results assuming visual extinction of 5 mag which corresponds to the lack 
of UV radiation. In that case, HCN is more abundant than CN by about 2-3
orders of magnitude. The column density ratio of CN and HCN weakly depends on the 
gas temperature, so we fix the gas temperature at 50K for envelopes of protostars and 200 K for outflows. The model does not include grain chemistry and evaporation of organic material from grains to the gas-phase. However, CN is much more reactive than HCN \textbf{what leads to assumption that lack of the grain chemistry cannot increase [CN]/[HCN] ratio.}

%=================================================

In the next step, we run the model for a
range of visual extinction between -$2.5$ and 2.5 mag that corresponds to
the UV radiation field G$_0$ of $4\times 10^{-4}$ to $2.4\times 10^{3}$. 
%\textbf{This UV radiation field is additional to the standard conditions in dense clouds}.
%We accounted for the HCNH$^+$ photodissociation into HCN$^+$ or HNC$^+$, and estimated the reaction rate coefficient as 10\% of the HCN photodissociation rate.
Figure \ref{G0_50} show the abundance ratio of CN and HCN as a function of
$n_\mathrm{H}$ and G$_0$ for two temperatures. The observed ratios 
of 1-10 match the calculated ratios in three regimes: for very weak UV fields (<$10^{-1}$ G$_0$),
for the relatively weak UV fields of $10^{-1}-10^1$ and relatively strong UV fields of $10^{2}-10^3$.
%Thus, the simulations are consistent with the presence of 
%The calculated column density ratio covers parameter
%space of all probed densities and G$_0$ range between $10^{-4}$ and 0.05 in weak UV radiation
%regime. The observed CN/HCN ratio is reproduced at the G$_0$ values greater than $1.5 \times 10^{3}$
%as well. HCN is more abundant than CN in very weak (<$10^{-3}$ G$_0$) radiation fields. This result
%is consistent with simulations of a starless cloud that leads to a conclusion that additional UV
%radiation source is needed to reproduce the observational ratios.

%The sets of models shown in this section indicate that CN/HCN column density ratio covers the range
%of 1-10 regardless of excitation conditions. This result suggests that the UV radiation may play an
%important role around low-mass protostars.

\section{Discussion}
\label{section:discussion}

%=================================================
%\subsection{Morphology of the UV-irradiated region}
%=================================================
%=================================================
\subsection{Comparison of the spatial extent of CN and HCN}
\label{subsection:extent}

%=================================================
The relative abundance of CN and HCN molecules is a widely used tracer of UV radiation in different
astronomical context: reflection nebulae (e.g. \citealt{Fue95}), proto-planetary disks (e.g.
\citealt{Cha12}) or proto-brown dwarfs (e.g. \citealt{Ria18}). CN is a product of photodissociation of
HCN with the photodissociation rate of $1.64\times10^{-9}$. CN has smaller photodissociation rate of
$5.19\times10^{-10}$ (\citealt{Hea17}), and is therefore less sensitive to photodissociation in comparison to HCN.
Since CN and HCN can be photodissociated selectively, the CN/HCN ratio probes regions
affected by UV radiation. The ratio is the highest near the source of the UV emission, and decreases
with the distance from the source (\citealt{Fue93}). 

Figure \ref{cn10_and_hcn10} shows a large-scale map of CN 1-0 and HCN 1-0. The CN 1-0 transition is shifted to the north with respect to the HCN 1-0 emission. It is
highly concentrated in the south-east subcluster, while the north-west subcluster is dominated by the HCN. Both
molecules show a diffusive ‘bridge’ between the two subclusters. It is connected with Ser SMM4 and
Ser~SMM1 outflows in HCN, while the CN follows the dust continuum emission. The emission in both
molecules is anti-correlated north from Ser SMM6 and west from Ser SMM4 sources. 
%At the dense area of Ser SMM9 surrounding, CN/HCN ratio is significantly lower.

Both species has been detected in all source positions. CN as a product of HCN photodissotiation
indicates other properties of low-mass protostars surroundings (Section~\ref{section:analysis}). The highest CN/HCN
integrated intensity ratio occurs in Ser SMM6 and Ser SMM3 protostars. On the other hand, Ser SMM9 object is characterised by very low CN/HCN line ratio.
Similarly low CN/HCN ratio is measured in outflow positions no. 3 and 4.

Majority of the sources show firm detection in both molecules (Table~\ref{table:CN/HCN}). However,
the variations in line fluxes indicate regions of different properties. The CN/HCN ratio varies
between protostars positions, as well as between off-source positions. This parameter does not seem to be correlated with the
evolutionary stage of a protostar. All the sources with the highest CN/HCN ratio are located in the south-east subcluster. Ser~SMM3 and Ser SMM6 are situated in close neighbourhood, in the area characterised
by high emission of CN 1-0 line. At Ser SMM9 and Ser SMM10 protostars the lowest CN/HCN ratio is
observed. Both sources are young, Class 0 YSOs. In addition they are separated by $\sim$0.095 pc from the other sources.

The same trend can be recognised in the integrated intensity ratio measured in the wings only. The highest ratio is present at the same protostars, although SMM12 shows the highest value in this case. It is located $\sim$0.127 away pc from the Ser~SMM3 and Ser SMM6 protostars, in the area with significantly lower HCN emission. No outflow is known from Ser SMM12. The \mbox{CO 6-5} line in the neighbourhood of Ser SMM12 does not indicate an outflow either. Extremely low CN and HCN ratio in the wings emission is connected with blue-shifted outflow from Ser~SMM4 (outflow position no. 3). In general, this ratio is lower towards outflows in comparison to protostars, indicating that UV radiation is produced in the closest neighbourhood of the protostars. The most prominent emission of the CN line is associated with protostars located in the south-east subcluster, and not related with the evolutionary stage of a source.

%Comparing CN/HCN results with similar plots of CN/CS and CS/HCN ratio (Fig.~\ref{CN/CS} and
%Fig.~\ref{CS/HCN} respectively) restricts the parameter space to very low-density and weakly
%irradiated gas or a dense gas with strong UV radiation. CN/CS ratio varies between 9 and 29 for the
%all protostars positions, while CS/HCN ratio is in range of 0.12-0.26. Astrochemical models computed
%for these molecules show similar behaviour to that presented for CN/HCN ratio. UV radiation with the
%strength of G$_0$ in order of $10^{3}-10^{4}$ is not very probable in low-mass protostars
%neighbourhood. At the protostars' positions high hydrogen densities can be assumed. Astronomical
%models show that an additional UV radiation source of the strength of few hundredth of the average
%interstellar UV radiation field is required to cover the observational ratios.

%CN/HCN ratio is widely used as an UV radiation tracer in photon dominated regions (e.g. \citealt{Thi04}, \citealt{Han15}).
HCN photodissociates into CN molecule and H atom, while CN requires more energetic photons (> 12.4
eV) to be disintegrated (\citealt{vDi87}). This should lead to a higher abundance of CN molecules and
an increase of CN/HCN column density ratio. However, our purely chemical model shows (Figure~\ref{G0_50}) a low CN/HCN ratio even at high UV field, while the [CN]/[HCN] ratio can be also shaped by several more factors, including: grain chemistry, evaporation, turbulence, \textbf{shelling}, shocks. Both production and destruction of each molecule need to be investigated in order to explain the reason behind HCN abundances being higher than expected. Detailed models of the most dominant
reactions for destruction and production of each molecule are presented in Figure~\ref{CN_dest} –
Fig.~\ref{HCN_prod} with the assumption of fixed 50 K temperature. Reaction flux is defined as
reactants abundances multiplied by reaction rate coefficient. If the accumulated total flux of all reactions contributed in the studied molecules destruction or production processes is greater than 80$\%$, these reactions are taken into consideration as dominant reactions.

%Fluxes of HCN photodissociation (Fig.~\ref{HCN_dest}) show that this reaction has marginal contribution in nitrogen chemistry up to G$_0$ $\approx$ 100.
%Low CN/HCN ratio found in astrochemical model for strongly irradiated gas is a surprising result.
The reactions distribution in the parameter space do not strongly depend on hydrogen
densities. The strength of UV radiation distinguishes the
dominant reactions. Three regimes are defined: with weak (G$_0$ < $10^{-1}$), intermediate (G$_0 \sim 10^{-1}-10^1$) and strong (G$_0$ > $10^{2}$) UV field. The reactions where CN or HCN production or destruction is greater than 30$\%$ are listed
in Table~\ref{reactions_50} as well as illustrated in Figure~\ref{reactions_mediumG0}, and in Figure~\ref{reactions_smallG0}-
Figure~\ref{reactions_largeG0}.

In the regime of weak UV radiation fields dominant formation channels of CN and HCN are reactions of nitrogen with hydrocarbons
(CH and CH$_2$ respectively). In denser areas the reaction between an electron and a CNC cation plays a role in the CN formation. In a weakly irradiated environment, atomic elements are more abundant in the neutral state, thus the destruction of CN is mostly dominated by the
reactions with neutral oxygen (60-70$\%$) or nitrogen (30$\%$ or less). HCN is less reactive, and reaction with neutral atoms are not very efficient in this case. The destruction of HCN is driven by many channels, but reactants are less abundant than neutral atoms. Simultaneous impact of a few different reactions is not as effective as the reaction ruling the CN destruction. Those factors lead to the higher HCN abundances compared to CN.

%More of the ionised atoms are produced with the increase of the UV radiation what blocks these effective channels of CN destruction.

In the regime of medium UV radiation field more ionized atoms are produced, and concentration of neutral atoms is low. It blocks effective channels of CN destruction, but opens an effective channel of HCN destruction: reaction with abundant C$^+$. This reaction
results in CNC$^+$ production which quickly reacts with an electron forming CN. That explains why CN/HCN ratio increases with larger radiation.

The direct photodissociation of HCN to H and CN becomes important at strong UV fields (Fig.~\ref{reactions_largeG0}). In consequence, a balance between CN and HCN depends on the UV emission of particular object, and cannot be reliably predicted by our model. In the region of strong UV fields all molecules are subject of dissociation and ionization. This leads to the concentration of polyatomic molecules decrees, while atomic and diatomic molecules become more abundant. In consequence, new channels of CN formation are open. We have to underline, that HCNH$^+$ is the main parent molecule of HCN, however the photodissociation rate of HCNH$^+$ is unknown. We extended our reaction network by the HCNH$^+$ photodissociation into HCN$^+$ or HNC$^+$, which does not affect the results. We estimated the reaction coefficient as 10\% of the HCN photodissociation rate. The rough estimation is based on the electronic transition intensities predicted by quantum chemical calculations at density functional theory in extended basis set.

Previous studies of energetic processes around low-mass protostars showed observational premises of
the influence of UV radiation on molecules. These works focused on intermediate-\textit{J} CO
transitions (up to 6-5) that traces gas with a kinetic temperature around 100 K. With the WISH project (\citealt{vDi11}) higher CO
rotational transitions (up to 49-48) were studied that provided information of two temperature
components seen in molecular outflows: warm with $T_\mathrm{rot} \approx 300$ K and hot with
$T_\mathrm{rot} \approx 600-800$ K (\citealt{Kar13}, \citealt{Gre13}). The observations of the water
molecule shows a broad and medium-broad components associated with non-dissociative \textit{C}-shocks and dissociative \textit{J}-shocks respectively (\citealt{Kri13}, \citealt{Mot14}). These
spectral components can be correlated to the CO rotational temperature components (\citealt{Kri17}).
Another tracers sensitive to UV radiation, ionised hydrides such as CH$^+$, OH$^+$ and H$_2$O$^+$,
were found in outflow cavities (\citealt{Ben16}). The UV fluxes were estimated as 10$^2$-10$^3$
higher than average interstellar radiation. There is no molecular evidence for influence of X-rays
for chemical compositions of low-mass protostars.

Most of the low-mass protostars have a broad, centered on $\varv_{\mathrm{source}}$ CO 16-15 and
H$_2$O component in their spectra (\citealt{Kri17}). There are typically $\approx 20$ km s$^{-1}$
broad and associated with cavity shocks. The emitting gas is located in shocks along the outflow
cavity wall or along the molecular wind (\citealt{Yva16}). Some of the sources show a
narrow, offset component as well that is seen in the PACS CO ladder with $T_\mathrm{rot} \approx
600-800$ K. The gas dissociated by UV photons and carried out form the protostar was proposed as an
origin of the pre-shock gas (\citealt{Kri17}). Thus, UV radiation can propagate in large
scales up to 1000 AU from the central protostar, changing the properties of their surroundings. The
hypothesis of the UV irradiated shocks is also raised based on H$_2$O/OH ratio observations. The
ratio showed a few order of magnitude disagreement with fully-shielded shock models
(\citealt{Kar14}). The observations are reproduced with predictions of \mbox{\textit{C}-shock} models
illuminated by UV photons of the strength 0.1-10 times the interstellar value (\citealt{Mel15}). The
other photodissociation tracers, fluxes of [OI] and [CII] are significantly higher than predicted by
fully-shielded \mbox{\textit{C}-shock} models (\citealt{Kar18}). Therefore, UV radiation may play
an important role in low-mass protostars surroundings.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{section:conclusions}

%=================================================
IRAM 30~m / EMIR observations of CN and HCN emission pin-point the location 
of the impact of UV radiation on the chemistry of low-mass star forming region in Serpens. 
A combination of simple models using radiative-code RADEX and chemical code Nahoon 
allows us to determine physical conditions of the gas, column densities of molecular species,
and estimate the UV radiation field strength. The main conclusions of our study are the 
following. 
%=================================================
\begin{itemize} 
\item The spatial extent of HCN 1-0 and CN 1-0 show significant differences, with 
HCN resembling the CO 6-5 and CS 3-2 emission tracing outflows and CN concentrated close to the individual protostar positions or their groups.
\item The ratios of CN and HCN systematically differ between protostar and outflow position,
both taking into account the integrated line profile and the line wings. The median of CN and HCN ratio is nearly two times lower in optically thin line wings than in the integrated line profile. The ratio 
is the highest at the positions of the protostars, confirming the impact of UV identified 
using \textit{Herschel} as a part of the WISH program. 
\item For typical densities of low-mass protostellar envelopes of $10^5$ cm$^{-3}$ and 
gas temperatures of $50$ K, the chemical network for nitrogen-bearing species is sensitive to UV photons. The ratio of [CN]/[HCN] is primarily driven by the UV radiation field, however, it should be used with care, as the relation between [CN]/[HCN] and UV radiation field strength is not monotonic. Several reactions shape the [CN]/[HCN] ratio. The photodissociation of HCN has an important contribution to nitrogen chemistry for G$_0$>100.
\item The column density ratios of CN and HCN equals 1-10, irrespectively of the gas parameters. The column density ratio cannot be reproduced by any chemical model without the UV radiation field. Our current estimations are the following: G$_0$ $\approx$ $10^{1}-10^{3}$ assuming 50 K and G$_0$ $\approx$ $10^{2}-10^{3}$ for warmer gas of 200K.
These values are in agreement with, yet in the higher end of the UV field strength obtained using 
H$_2$O and OH ratios from \textit{Herschel}.
\end{itemize}

Similar observations for a larger sample of sources is needed to fully exploit 
the impact of UV radiation on the physical and chemical conditions in low-mass star 
forming regions. Detailed 3D modelling of protostellar envelopes with outflow cavities 
is necessary to fully constrain the strengths of the UV fields in physical components 
of young stellar objects.

\section{Spectral Energy Distributions}


Broad-band observations are needed in order to determine physical properties of a protostar. \cite{Dun15} studied protostars in the Serpens molecular cloud using 2MASS
(\citealt{Skr06}) and Spitzer IRAC/MIPS (\citealt{Eva09}), observations covering the range
1.25–70 $\mu$m, photometry from Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer 12 and 22 $\mu$m (WISE;
\citealt{Wri10}), SHARC-II 350 $\mu$m (\citealt{Sur16}), the SCUBA Legacy Catalog 450 and 850 $\mu$m
(\citealt{dFr08}) and 1.1 mm observations from Bolocam dust survey (\citealt{Eno07}). The Serpens
Main region was also observed \textbf{in} the \textit{Herschel} Gould Belt survey project (\citealt{And10}) at 70, 160, 250, 350 and 500 $\mu$m.
SPIRE/PACS photometry in the Serpens molecular cloud is discussed in Fiorellino et al. (in prep.). The flux densites used in the SED analysis are \textbf{presented} in Tab.~\ref{SED_data}.

Based on SEDs, the bolometric temperature and luminosity can be calculated for each of the observed
protostars. The bolometric luminosity \textbf{is} determined by integrating the SEDs over frequency:
\begin{equation} \label{eq6} L_{bol} = 4 \pi \, d^2 \, \int F_\nu d\nu \end{equation} where $d$ is the
cloud distance of $436 \pm 9.2$ pc (\citealt{Ort17}). The bolometric temperature is calculating as
described in \cite{Mye93}: \begin{equation} \label{eq7} T_{bol} = 1.25 \, 10^{-11} \, \bar{\nu}
\end{equation} where $\bar{\nu}$ is the mean frequency given by: \begin{equation} \label{eq8}
\bar{\nu} = \frac{\int \nu F_\nu d\nu}{ \int F_\nu d\nu} \end{equation}

Using Scipy \textit{splrep} and \textit{splev} functions cubic smooth spline interpolation of the
photometric data \textbf{is obtained} while calculating the protostars parameters. Integration along the
resulting axis is obtain with the composite trapezoidal rule (\textit{Scipy} package). The
photometric data allows us to perform the integration along wide range of wavelength with exception
of SMM8. Here we have only 4 photometric points from the \textit{Herschel} Gould Belt so the calculated
bolometric luminosity and temperature can be underestimated.

\section{Maps in additional tracers}
\label{app:maps}

IRAM 30m spectral line maps in HCN and CS isotopologues are presented in Fig.~\ref{h13cn10} and Fig.~\ref{c34s32}. The H$^{13}$CN 1-0 emission is a sum of all hyperfine splitting components. The H$^{13}$CN 1-0 is spatially consistent with \mbox{HCN 1-0}, although a few times weaker. It peaks around Ser SMM2, Ser SMM4 and Ser SMM9, as well as at the outflow position no.~3. Except for the Ser SMM2 protostar, the peaks in H$^{13}$CN 1-0 are co-spatial with the HCN emission peaks. The emission of H$^{13}$CN 1-0 line is similarly strong in the \textbf{south-east} and \textbf{north-west} regions of the map.

The C$^{34}$S 3-2 line does not show such extended emission, although it \textbf{is} detected in all outflow positions. The emission is concentrated mostly near Ser SMM1, Ser SMM4 and Ser SMM9 sources, unlike the CS 3-2 which is not that significant around Ser SMM1. The isotopologues trace the same gas as their regular counterparts.

\section{Molecular line profiles}
\label{app:lines}

The targeted lines \textbf{are} detected in most of the protostars and outflow positions. Fig.~\ref{Spectra_all} shows the spectra in C$^{34}$S 3-2, CS 3-2, H$^{13}$CN 2-1, H$^{13}$CN 1-0, HCN 1-0 and CN 1-0 lines obtained with the IRAM 30m, as well as profiles in CO 6-5 observed with APEX-CHAMP$^+$. The spectra at the Ser SMM4 position are shown in Fig.~\ref{SMM4spectra}. The H$^{13}$CN 2-1 line \textbf{is} detected only at Ser~SMM4 and Ser SMM9 sources. The Ser SMM8 protostar is outside of the mapping area in CO 6-5.

\section{Line fluxes and observed column densities}
\label{app:fluxes}

Table~\ref{table:fluxes} lists the observed lines and their properties calculated at protostars positions. The \textbf{velocity} integrated intensity is measured at 3$\sigma$ level for each spectrum separately. The peak temperature $T_\mathrm{peak}$ is the value at the maximum of a line or of the strongest hyperfine component. Column densities at the upper lever $N_\mathrm{up}$ and total column densities $N_\mathrm{tot}$ \textbf{are} calculated as described in \S 4.1 (Eq.~\ref{eq3} and Eq.~\ref{eq4}).

\section{Dominant reactions in CN, HCN chemistry}
\label{app:reactions}

Dominant processes in CN and HCN reactions modelled at a temperature of 50 K are listed in Tab.~\ref{reactions_50}. The processes are illustrated in the Nahoon model parameter space: main channels of HCN and CN destruction, as well as HCN and CN production (Fig.~\ref{HCN_dest} and Fig.~\ref{CN_dest} - Fig.~\ref{CN_prod} respectively). Only the reactions contributing at least 30\% in total flux \textbf{are} taken into consideration. Dominant reactions are more dependent on the strength of the UV radiation than on the hydrogen density. Reaction networks for UV radiation in weak (G$_0$ = $10^{-4} - 10^{-1}$), intermediate (G$_0$ = $10^{-1} - 10^{1}$) and strong (G$_0$ = $10^{1} - 10^{6}$) regime are presented in Fig.~\ref{reactions_smallG0}, Fig.~\ref{reactions_mediumG0} and Fig.~\ref{reactions_largeG0} respectively. Not only the dominant reactions, but also the main route of the reactants production \textbf{are} illustrated. The dominant processes modelled assuming the temperature of 200 K are listed in Tab.~\ref{reactions_200}.

\section{Correlations with T$_\mathrm{bol}$ and L$_\mathrm{bol}$} 

Fig.~\ref{Tbol_Lbol} compares the luminosity in CN 1-0, HCN 1-0 and \mbox{CS 3-2} lines in respect to the bolometric luminosities and temperatures of the observed protostars. A molecule luminosity is calculated based on the integrated intensity of a line at 3$\sigma$ level. The integrated flux in K km s$^{-1}$ unit is converted to Jy km s$^{-1}$ using conversion factors Jy/K tabularised in 'Proposals for IRAM Telescopes' document\footnote{https://www.iram.fr/GENERAL/calls/w07/w07/node33.html}. Then, Jy is converted to W and divided by the wavelength in km. The luminosity in a line is calculated by the standard relation between luminosity $L$ and flux $F$ (Eq.~\ref{eq8}) and expressed in solar luminosities.
\begin{equation} 
\label{eq8} 
L = F \; 4 \; \pi \; d^{2}
\end{equation}
where distance $d$ is $436 \pm 9.2$ pc (\citealt{Ort17}).
